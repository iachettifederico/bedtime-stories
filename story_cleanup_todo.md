# Bedtime Stories Cleanup Progress Tracker

## Purpose
This file tracks the progress of cleaning up all story files in the bedtime-stories repository. The goal is to ensure each story file:

1. **Contains only one complete story** (split files with multiple stories)
2. **Has clean, human-readable content** without boilerplate or formatting garbage
3. **Proper YAML front matter** with title, author, and source
4. **Story content only** - remove any project gutenberg headers, footers, or other non-story text

**Strategy**: Work through simple single-story files first, then tackle major collection files that need splitting.
