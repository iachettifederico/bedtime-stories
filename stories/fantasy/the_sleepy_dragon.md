In the highest tower of Castle Cloudpeak lived Dozbert, the sleepiest dragon in all the land.

While other dragons spent their days roaring and flying, Dozbert preferred napping on his pile of pillows and soft quilts instead of gold and jewels.

One evening, the village children couldn't fall asleep because of a terrible thunderstorm. They climbed the winding stairs to Dozbert's tower.

"Please help us," they asked. "We're too scared to sleep."

Dozbert yawned a great big yawn that smelled like warm milk and honey. "I know just the thing," he said sleepily.

He took a deep breath and instead of fire, he breathed out the softest, most melodic lullaby. The gentle tune floated down to the village like a warm blanket.

Soon, every child in the village was fast asleep, dreaming of friendly dragons and cozy towers.

Dozbert smiled drowsily and curled up on his pillow pile. Being the sleepiest dragon was the best job of all.
