Every night at the stroke of midnight, the books in Luna's bedroom came alive.

The fairy tale book fluttered its pages like wings, while the poetry book hummed soft verses. Her atlas unfolded itself to show magical lands that only appeared after dark.

But her favorite was the little picture book about a lonely moon. As midnight chimed, a silvery light spilled from its pages, and the moon character stepped right out of the story.

"Would you like to visit the night garden?" asked the Moon, extending a glowing hand.

Together they floated through Luna's window to a garden that existed only in moonlight. Flowers made of starshine swayed in the gentle breeze, and fireflies wrote stories in the air with their glowing trails.

Luna and the Moon sat by a pond that reflected not Luna's face, but all her sweetest dreams.

As dawn approached, the Moon walked Luna back to her room and stepped back into the picture book.

Luna fell asleep holding the book close, knowing her friend would return when midnight came again.
