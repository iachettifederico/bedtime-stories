I. Silver Blaze


      I am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,” said Holmes, as we
      sat down together to our breakfast one morning.

      “Go! Where to?”

      “To Dartmoor; to King’s Pyland.”

      I was not surprised. Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not
      already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the
      one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of
      England. For a whole day my companion had rambled about the room
      with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and
      recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and
      absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. Fresh editions
      of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be
      glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Yet, silent as he
      was, I knew perfectly well what it was over which he was
      brooding. There was but one problem before the public which could
      challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular
      disappearance of the favourite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic
      murder of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly announced his
      intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was only
      what I had both expected and hoped for.

      “I should be most happy to go down with you if I should not be in
      the way,” said I.

      “My dear Watson, you would confer a great favour upon me by
      coming. And I think that your time will not be misspent, for
      there are points about the case which promise to make it an
      absolutely unique one. We have, I think, just time to catch our
      train at Paddington, and I will go further into the matter upon
      our journey. You would oblige me by bringing with you your very
      excellent field-glass.”

      And so it happened that an hour or so later I found myself in the
      corner of a first-class carriage flying along en route for
      Exeter, while Sherlock Holmes, with his sharp, eager face framed
      in his ear-flapped travelling-cap, dipped rapidly into the bundle
      of fresh papers which he had procured at Paddington. We had left
      Reading far behind us before he thrust the last one of them under
      the seat, and offered me his cigar-case.

      “We are going well,” said he, looking out the window and glancing
      at his watch. “Our rate at present is fifty-three and a half
      miles an hour.”

      “I have not observed the quarter-mile posts,” said I.

      “Nor have I. But the telegraph posts upon this line are sixty
      yards apart, and the calculation is a simple one. I presume that
      you have looked into this matter of the murder of John Straker
      and the disappearance of Silver Blaze?”

      “I have seen what the _Telegraph_ and the _Chronicle_ have to
      say.”

      “It is one of those cases where the art of the reasoner should be
      used rather for the sifting of details than for the acquiring of
      fresh evidence. The tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete and
      of such personal importance to so many people, that we are
      suffering from a plethora of surmise, conjecture, and hypothesis.
      The difficulty is to detach the framework of fact—of absolute
      undeniable fact—from the embellishments of theorists and
      reporters. Then, having established ourselves upon this sound
      basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may be drawn and
      what are the special points upon which the whole mystery turns.
      On Tuesday evening I received telegrams from both Colonel Ross,
      the owner of the horse, and from Inspector Gregory, who is
      looking after the case, inviting my co-operation.”

      “Tuesday evening!” I exclaimed. “And this is Thursday morning.
      Why didn’t you go down yesterday?”

      “Because I made a blunder, my dear Watson—which is, I am afraid,
      a more common occurrence than any one would think who only knew
      me through your memoirs. The fact is that I could not believe it
      possible that the most remarkable horse in England could long
      remain concealed, especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as
      the north of Dartmoor. From hour to hour yesterday I expected to
      hear that he had been found, and that his abductor was the
      murderer of John Straker. When, however, another morning had
      come, and I found that beyond the arrest of young Fitzroy Simpson
      nothing had been done, I felt that it was time for me to take
      action. Yet in some ways I feel that yesterday has not been
      wasted.”

      “You have formed a theory, then?”

      “At least I have got a grip of the essential facts of the case. I
      shall enumerate them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much
      as stating it to another person, and I can hardly expect your
      co-operation if I do not show you the position from which we
      start.”

      I lay back against the cushions, puffing at my cigar, while
      Holmes, leaning forward, with his long, thin forefinger checking
      off the points upon the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch
      of the events which had led to our journey.

      “Silver Blaze,” said he, “is from the Isonomy stock, and holds as
      brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. He is now in his fifth
      year, and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to
      Colonel Ross, his fortunate owner. Up to the time of the
      catastrophe he was the first favourite for the Wessex Cup, the
      betting being three to one on him. He has always, however, been a
      prime favourite with the racing public, and has never yet
      disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums of
      money have been laid upon him. It is obvious, therefore, that
      there were many people who had the strongest interest in
      preventing Silver Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag
      next Tuesday.

      “The fact was, of course, appreciated at King’s Pyland, where the
      Colonel’s training-stable is situated. Every precaution was taken
      to guard the favourite. The trainer, John Straker, is a retired
      jockey who rode in Colonel Ross’s colours before he became too
      heavy for the weighing-chair. He has served the Colonel for five
      years as jockey and for seven as trainer, and has always shown
      himself to be a zealous and honest servant. Under him were three
      lads; for the establishment was a small one, containing only four
      horses in all. One of these lads sat up each night in the stable,
      while the others slept in the loft. All three bore excellent
      characters. John Straker, who is a married man, lived in a small
      villa about two hundred yards from the stables. He has no
      children, keeps one maid-servant, and is comfortably off. The
      country round is very lonely, but about half a mile to the north
      there is a small cluster of villas which have been built by a
      Tavistock contractor for the use of invalids and others who may
      wish to enjoy the pure Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself lies two
      miles to the west, while across the moor, also about two miles
      distant, is the larger training establishment of Mapleton, which
      belongs to Lord Backwater, and is managed by Silas Brown. In
      every other direction the moor is a complete wilderness,
      inhabited only by a few roaming gypsies. Such was the general
      situation last Monday night when the catastrophe occurred.

      “On that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as
      usual, and the stables were locked up at nine o’clock. Two of the
      lads walked up to the trainer’s house, where they had supper in
      the kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter, remained on guard. At a
      few minutes after nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to
      the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried
      mutton. She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the
      stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink
      nothing else. The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very
      dark and the path ran across the open moor.

      “Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man
      appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he
      stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she
      saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a
      grey suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. He wore gaiters, and
      carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. She was most impressed,
      however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness
      of his manner. His age, she thought, would be rather over thirty
      than under it.

      “‘Can you tell me where I am?’ he asked. ‘I had almost made up my
      mind to sleep on the moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.’

      “‘You are close to the King’s Pyland training-stables,’ said she.

      “‘Oh, indeed! What a stroke of luck!’ he cried. ‘I understand
      that a stable-boy sleeps there alone every night. Perhaps that is
      his supper which you are carrying to him. Now I am sure that you
      would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would
      you?’ He took a piece of white paper folded up out of his
      waistcoat pocket. ‘See that the boy has this to-night, and you
      shall have the prettiest frock that money can buy.’

      “She was frightened by the earnestness of his manner, and ran
      past him to the window through which she was accustomed to hand
      the meals. It was already opened, and Hunter was seated at the
      small table inside. She had begun to tell him of what had
      happened, when the stranger came up again.

      “‘Good-evening,’ said he, looking through the window. ‘I wanted
      to have a word with you.’ The girl has sworn that as he spoke she
      noticed the corner of the little paper packet protruding from his
      closed hand.

      “‘What business have you here?’ asked the lad.

      “‘It’s business that may put something into your pocket,’ said
      the other. ‘You’ve two horses in for the Wessex Cup—Silver Blaze
      and Bayard. Let me have the straight tip and you won’t be a
      loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the
      other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have
      put their money on him?’

      “‘So, you’re one of those damned touts!’ cried the lad. ‘I’ll
      show you how we serve them in King’s Pyland.’ He sprang up and
      rushed across the stable to unloose the dog. The girl fled away
      to the house, but as she ran she looked back and saw that the
      stranger was leaning through the window. A minute later, however,
      when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though he
      ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him.”

      “One moment,” I asked. “Did the stable-boy, when he ran out with
      the dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?”

      “Excellent, Watson, excellent!” murmured my companion. “The
      importance of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a
      special wire to Dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. The
      boy locked the door before he left it. The window, I may add, was
      not large enough for a man to get through.

      “Hunter waited until his fellow-grooms had returned, when he sent
      a message to the trainer and told him what had occurred. Straker
      was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to
      have quite realized its true significance. It left him, however,
      vaguely uneasy, and Mrs. Straker, waking at one in the morning,
      found that he was dressing. In reply to her inquiries, he said
      that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the
      horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see
      that all was well. She begged him to remain at home, as she could
      hear the rain pattering against the window, but in spite of her
      entreaties he pulled on his large mackintosh and left the house.

      “Mrs. Straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her
      husband had not yet returned. She dressed herself hastily, called
      the maid, and set off for the stables. The door was open; inside,
      huddled together upon a chair, Hunter was sunk in a state of
      absolute stupor, the favourite’s stall was empty, and there were
      no signs of his trainer.

      “The two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the
      harness-room were quickly aroused. They had heard nothing during
      the night, for they are both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously
      under the influence of some powerful drug, and as no sense could
      be got out of him, he was left to sleep it off while the two lads
      and the two women ran out in search of the absentees. They still
      had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken out the
      horse for early exercise, but on ascending the knoll near the
      house, from which all the neighbouring moors were visible, they
      not only could see no signs of the missing favourite, but they
      perceived something which warned them that they were in the
      presence of a tragedy.

      “About a quarter of a mile from the stables John Straker’s
      overcoat was flapping from a furze-bush. Immediately beyond there
      was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of
      this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. His head
      had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and
      he was wounded on the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut,
      inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was clear,
      however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his
      assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which
      was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he
      clasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognised by the
      maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger
      who had visited the stables.

      “Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive
      as to the ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that
      the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his
      curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman.

      “As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud
      which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been
      there at the time of the struggle. But from that morning he has
      disappeared, and although a large reward has been offered, and
      all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of
      him. Finally, an analysis has shown that the remains of his
      supper left by the stable-lad contain an appreciable quantity of
      powdered opium, while the people at the house partook of the same
      dish on the same night without any ill effect.

      “Those are the main facts of the case, stripped of all surmise,
      and stated as baldly as possible. I shall now recapitulate what
      the police have done in the matter.

      “Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an
      extremely competent officer. Were he but gifted with imagination
      he might rise to great heights in his profession. On his arrival
      he promptly found and arrested the man upon whom suspicion
      naturally rested. There was little difficulty in finding him, for
      he inhabited one of those villas which I have mentioned. His
      name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man of excellent
      birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf,
      and who lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel book-making
      in the sporting clubs of London. An examination of his
      betting-book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand
      pounds had been registered by him against the favourite.

      “On being arrested he volunteered the statement that he had come
      down to Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about
      the King’s Pyland horses, and also about Desborough, the second
      favourite, which was in charge of Silas Brown at the Mapleton
      stables. He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as
      described upon the evening before, but declared that he had no
      sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand
      information. When confronted with his cravat, he turned very
      pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the
      hand of the murdered man. His wet clothing showed that he had
      been out in the storm of the night before, and his stick, which
      was a Penang-lawyer weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as
      might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to
      which the trainer had succumbed.

      “On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the
      state of Straker’s knife would show that one at least of his
      assailants must bear his mark upon him. There you have it all in
      a nutshell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I shall be
      infinitely obliged to you.”

      I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which
      Holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. Though
      most of the facts were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently
      appreciated their relative importance, nor their connection to
      each other.

      “Is it not possible,” I suggested, “that the incised wound upon
      Straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive
      struggles which follow any brain injury?”

      “It is more than possible; it is probable,” said Holmes. “In that
      case one of the main points in favour of the accused disappears.”

      “And yet,” said I, “even now I fail to understand what the theory
      of the police can be.”

      “I am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave
      objections to it,” returned my companion. “The police imagine, I
      take it, that this Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the lad, and
      having in some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the stable
      door and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of
      kidnapping him altogether. His bridle is missing, so that Simpson
      must have put this on. Then, having left the door open behind
      him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was
      either met or overtaken by the trainer. A row naturally ensued.
      Simpson beat out the trainer’s brains with his heavy stick
      without receiving any injury from the small knife which Straker
      used in self-defence, and then the thief either led the horse on
      to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have bolted during
      the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. That is the
      case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all
      other explanations are more improbable still. However, I shall
      very quickly test the matter when I am once upon the spot, and
      until then I cannot really see how we can get much further than
      our present position.”

      It was evening before we reached the little town of Tavistock,
      which lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge
      circle of Dartmoor. Two gentlemen were awaiting us in the
      station—the one a tall, fair man with lion-like hair and beard
      and curiously penetrating light blue eyes; the other a small,
      alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters,
      with trim little side-whiskers and an eye-glass. The latter was
      Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman; the other, Inspector
      Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English
      detective service.

      “I am delighted that you have come down, Mr. Holmes,” said the
      Colonel. “The Inspector here has done all that could possibly be
      suggested, but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to
      avenge poor Straker and in recovering my horse.”

      “Have there been any fresh developments?” asked Holmes.

      “I am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,” said
      the Inspector. “We have an open carriage outside, and as you
      would no doubt like to see the place before the light fails, we
      might talk it over as we drive.”

      A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau, and
      were rattling through the quaint old Devonshire city. Inspector
      Gregory was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks,
      while Holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection.
      Colonel Ross leaned back with his arms folded and his hat tilted
      over his eyes, while I listened with interest to the dialogue of
      the two detectives. Gregory was formulating his theory, which was
      almost exactly what Holmes had foretold in the train.

      “The net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy Simpson,” he
      remarked, “and I believe myself that he is our man. At the same
      time I recognise that the evidence is purely circumstantial, and
      that some new development may upset it.”

      “How about Straker’s knife?”

      “We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in
      his fall.”

      “My friend Dr. Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down.
      If so, it would tell against this man Simpson.”

      “Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The
      evidence against him is certainly very strong. He had a great
      interest in the disappearance of the favourite. He lies under
      suspicion of having poisoned the stable-boy, he was undoubtedly
      out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick, and his cravat
      was found in the dead man’s hand. I really think we have enough
      to go before a jury.”

      Holmes shook his head. “A clever counsel would tear it all to
      rags,” said he. “Why should he take the horse out of the stable?
      If he wished to injure it why could he not do it there? Has a
      duplicate key been found in his possession? What chemist sold him
      the powdered opium? Above all, where could he, a stranger to the
      district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own
      explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to
      the stable-boy?”

      “He says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his
      purse. But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they
      seem. He is not a stranger to the district. He has twice lodged
      at Tavistock in the summer. The opium was probably brought from
      London. The key, having served its purpose, would be hurled away.
      The horse may be at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines
      upon the moor.”

      “What does he say about the cravat?”

      “He acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost
      it. But a new element has been introduced into the case which may
      account for his leading the horse from the stable.”

      Holmes pricked up his ears.

      “We have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped
      on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took
      place. On Tuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that there was
      some understanding between Simpson and these gypsies, might he
      not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken,
      and may they not have him now?”

      “It is certainly possible.”

      “The moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I have also
      examined every stable and out-house in Tavistock, and for a
      radius of ten miles.”

      “There is another training-stable quite close, I understand?”

      “Yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect.
      As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had
      an interest in the disappearance of the favourite. Silas Brown,
      the trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event, and
      he was no friend to poor Straker. We have, however, examined the
      stables, and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.”

      “And nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of
      the Mapleton stables?”

      “Nothing at all.”

      Holmes leaned back in the carriage, and the conversation ceased.
      A few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little
      red-brick villa with overhanging eaves which stood by the road.
      Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long grey-tiled
      out-building. In every other direction the low curves of the
      moor, bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched away to
      the sky-line, broken only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a
      cluster of houses away to the westward which marked the Mapleton
      stables. We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who
      continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front
      of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. It was only when I
      touched his arm that he roused himself with a violent start and
      stepped out of the carriage.

      “Excuse me,” said he, turning to Colonel Ross, who had looked at
      him in some surprise. “I was day-dreaming.” There was a gleam in
      his eyes and a suppressed excitement in his manner which
      convinced me, used as I was to his ways, that his hand was upon a
      clue, though I could not imagine where he had found it.

      “Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the
      crime, Mr. Holmes?” said Gregory.

      “I think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into
      one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I
      presume?”

      “Yes; he lies upstairs. The inquest is to-morrow.”

      “He has been in your service some years, Colonel Ross?”

      “I have always found him an excellent servant.”

      “I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his
      pockets at the time of his death, Inspector?”

      “I have the things themselves in the sitting-room, if you would
      care to see them.”

      “I should be very glad.” We all filed into the front room and sat
      round the central table while the Inspector unlocked a square tin
      box and laid a small heap of things before us. There was a box of
      vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an A.D.P. briar-root pipe, a
      pouch of seal-skin with half an ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a
      silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an
      aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife
      with a very delicate, inflexible blade marked Weiss & Co.,
      London.

      “This is a very singular knife,” said Holmes, lifting it up and
      examining it minutely. “I presume, as I see blood-stains upon it,
      that it is the one which was found in the dead man’s grasp.
      Watson, this knife is surely in your line?”

      “It is what we call a cataract knife,” said I.

      “I thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate
      work. A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough
      expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.”

      “The tip was guarded by a disk of cork which we found beside his
      body,” said the Inspector. “His wife tells us that the knife had
      lain upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he
      left the room. It was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he
      could lay his hands on at the moment.”

      “Very possible. How about these papers?”

      “Three of them are receipted hay-dealers’ accounts. One of them
      is a letter of instructions from Colonel Ross. This other is a
      milliner’s account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen made out by
      Madame Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William Derbyshire. Mrs.
      Straker tells us that Derbyshire was a friend of her husband’s
      and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.”

      “Madam Derbyshire had somewhat expensive tastes,” remarked
      Holmes, glancing down the account. “Twenty-two guineas is rather
      heavy for a single costume. However there appears to be nothing
      more to learn, and we may now go down to the scene of the crime.”

      As we emerged from the sitting-room a woman, who had been waiting
      in the passage, took a step forward and laid her hand upon the
      Inspector’s sleeve. Her face was haggard and thin and eager,
      stamped with the print of a recent horror.

      “Have you got them? Have you found them?” she panted.

      “No, Mrs. Straker. But Mr. Holmes here has come from London to
      help us, and we shall do all that is possible.”

      “Surely I met you in Plymouth at a garden-party some little time
      ago, Mrs. Straker?” said Holmes.

      “No, sir; you are mistaken.”

      “Dear me! Why, I could have sworn to it. You wore a costume of
      dove-coloured silk with ostrich-feather trimming.”

      “I never had such a dress, sir,” answered the lady.

      “Ah, that quite settles it,” said Holmes. And with an apology he
      followed the Inspector outside. A short walk across the moor took
      us to the hollow in which the body had been found. At the brink
      of it was the furze-bush upon which the coat had been hung.

      “There was no wind that night, I understand,” said Holmes.

      “None; but very heavy rain.”

      “In that case the overcoat was not blown against the furze-bush,
      but placed there.”

      “Yes, it was laid across the bush.”

      “You fill me with interest, I perceive that the ground has been
      trampled up a good deal. No doubt many feet have been here since
      Monday night.”

      “A piece of matting has been laid here at the side, and we have
      all stood upon that.”

      “Excellent.”

      “In this bag I have one of the boots which Straker wore, one of
      Fitzroy Simpson’s shoes, and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.”

      “My dear Inspector, you surpass yourself!” Holmes took the bag,
      and, descending into the hollow, he pushed the matting into a
      more central position. Then stretching himself upon his face and
      leaning his chin upon his hands, he made a careful study of the
      trampled mud in front of him. “Hullo!” said he, suddenly. “What’s
      this?” It was a wax vesta half burned, which was so coated with
      mud that it looked at first like a little chip of wood.

      “I cannot think how I came to overlook it,” said the Inspector,
      with an expression of annoyance.

      “It was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw it because I was
      looking for it.”

      “What! You expected to find it?”

      “I thought it not unlikely.”

      He took the boots from the bag, and compared the impressions of
      each of them with marks upon the ground. Then he clambered up to
      the rim of the hollow, and crawled about among the ferns and
      bushes.

      “I am afraid that there are no more tracks,” said the Inspector.
      “I have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in
      each direction.”

      “Indeed!” said Holmes, rising. “I should not have the
      impertinence to do it again after what you say. But I should like
      to take a little walk over the moor before it grows dark, that I
      may know my ground to-morrow, and I think that I shall put this
      horseshoe into my pocket for luck.”

      Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my
      companion’s quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his
      watch. “I wish you would come back with me, Inspector,” said he.
      “There are several points on which I should like your advice, and
      especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public to remove
      our horse’s name from the entries for the Cup.”

      “Certainly not,” cried Holmes, with decision. “I should let the
      name stand.”

      The Colonel bowed. “I am very glad to have had your opinion,
      sir,” said he. “You will find us at poor Straker’s house when you
      have finished your walk, and we can drive together into
      Tavistock.”

      He turned back with the Inspector, while Holmes and I walked
      slowly across the moor. The sun was beginning to sink behind the
      stables of Mapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front of us
      was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy browns where the
      faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. But the
      glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my companion, who
      was sunk in the deepest thought.

      “It’s this way, Watson,” said he at last. “We may leave the
      question of who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine
      ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse. Now,
      supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy, where
      could he have gone to? The horse is a very gregarious creature.
      If left to himself his instincts would have been either to return
      to King’s Pyland or go over to Mapleton. Why should he run wild
      upon the moor? He would surely have been seen by now. And why
      should gypsies kidnap him? These people always clear out when
      they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the
      police. They could not hope to sell such a horse. They would run
      a great risk and gain nothing by taking him. Surely that is
      clear.”

      “Where is he, then?”

      “I have already said that he must have gone to King’s Pyland or
      to Mapleton. He is not at King’s Pyland. Therefore he is at
      Mapleton. Let us take that as a working hypothesis and see what
      it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the Inspector remarked,
      is very hard and dry. But it falls away towards Mapleton, and you
      can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which
      must have been very wet on Monday night. If our supposition is
      correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there is the
      point where we should look for his tracks.”

      We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few
      more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmes’
      request I walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left,
      but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout,
      and saw him waving his hand to me. The track of a horse was
      plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe
      which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression.

      “See the value of imagination,” said Holmes. “It is the one
      quality which Gregory lacks. We imagined what might have
      happened, acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves
      justified. Let us proceed.”

      We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile
      of dry, hard turf. Again the ground sloped, and again we came on
      the tracks. Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick
      them up once more quite close to Mapleton. It was Holmes who saw
      them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his
      face. A man’s track was visible beside the horse’s.

      “The horse was alone before,” I cried.

      “Quite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is this?”

      The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of
      King’s Pyland. Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after
      it. His eyes were on the trail, but I happened to look a little
      to one side, and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming back
      again in the opposite direction.

      “One for you, Watson,” said Holmes, when I pointed it out. “You
      have saved us a long walk, which would have brought us back on
      our own traces. Let us follow the return track.”

      We had not to go far. It ended at the paving of asphalt which led
      up to the gates of the Mapleton stables. As we approached, a
      groom ran out from them.

      “We don’t want any loiterers about here,” said he.

      “I only wished to ask a question,” said Holmes, with his finger
      and thumb in his waistcoat pocket. “Should I be too early to see
      your master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call at five o’clock
      to-morrow morning?”

      “Bless you, sir, if any one is about he will be, for he is always
      the first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your questions
      for himself. No, sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to
      let him see me touch your money. Afterwards, if you like.”

      As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn
      from his pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the
      gate with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.

      “What’s this, Dawson!” he cried. “No gossiping! Go about your
      business! And you, what the devil do you want here?”

      “Ten minutes’ talk with you, my good sir,” said Holmes in the
      sweetest of voices.

      “I’ve no time to talk to every gadabout. We want no strangers
      here. Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.”

      Holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer’s
      ear. He started violently and flushed to the temples.

      “It’s a lie!” he shouted, “an infernal lie!”

      “Very good. Shall we argue about it here in public or talk it
      over in your parlour?”

      “Oh, come in if you wish to.”

      Holmes smiled. “I shall not keep you more than a few minutes,
      Watson,” said he. “Now, Mr. Brown, I am quite at your disposal.”

      It was twenty minutes, and the reds had all faded into greys
      before Holmes and the trainer reappeared. Never have I seen such
      a change as had been brought about in Silas Brown in that short
      time. His face was ashy pale, beads of perspiration shone upon
      his brow, and his hands shook until the hunting-crop wagged like
      a branch in the wind. His bullying, overbearing manner was all
      gone too, and he cringed along at my companion’s side like a dog
      with its master.

      “Your instructions will be done. It shall all be done,” said he.

      “There must be no mistake,” said Holmes, looking round at him.
      The other winced as he read the menace in his eyes.

      “Oh no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be there. Should I
      change it first or not?”

      Holmes thought a little and then burst out laughing. “No, don’t,”
      said he; “I shall write to you about it. No tricks, now, or—”

      “Oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!”

      “Yes, I think I can. Well, you shall hear from me to-morrow.” He
      turned upon his heel, disregarding the trembling hand which the
      other held out to him, and we set off for King’s Pyland.

      “A more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than
      Master Silas Brown I have seldom met with,” remarked Holmes as we
      trudged along together.

      “He has the horse, then?”

      “He tried to bluster out of it, but I described to him so exactly
      what his actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced
      that I was watching him. Of course you observed the peculiarly
      square toes in the impressions, and that his own boots exactly
      corresponded to them. Again, of course no subordinate would have
      dared to do such a thing. I described to him how, when according
      to his custom he was the first down, he perceived a strange horse
      wandering over the moor. How he went out to it, and his
      astonishment at recognising, from the white forehead which has
      given the favourite its name, that chance had put in his power
      the only horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his
      money. Then I described how his first impulse had been to lead
      him back to King’s Pyland, and how the devil had shown him how he
      could hide the horse until the race was over, and how he had led
      it back and concealed it at Mapleton. When I told him every
      detail he gave it up and thought only of saving his own skin.”

      “But his stables had been searched?”

      “Oh, an old horse-faker like him has many a dodge.”

      “But are you not afraid to leave the horse in his power now,
      since he has every interest in injuring it?”

      “My dear fellow, he will guard it as the apple of his eye. He
      knows that his only hope of mercy is to produce it safe.”

      “Colonel Ross did not impress me as a man who would be likely to
      show much mercy in any case.”

      “The matter does not rest with Colonel Ross. I follow my own
      methods, and tell as much or as little as I choose. That is the
      advantage of being unofficial. I don’t know whether you observed
      it, Watson, but the Colonel’s manner has been just a trifle
      cavalier to me. I am inclined now to have a little amusement at
      his expense. Say nothing to him about the horse.”

      “Certainly not without your permission.”

      “And of course this is all quite a minor point compared to the
      question of who killed John Straker.”

      “And you will devote yourself to that?”

      “On the contrary, we both go back to London by the night train.”

      I was thunderstruck by my friend’s words. We had only been a few
      hours in Devonshire, and that he should give up an investigation
      which he had begun so brilliantly was quite incomprehensible to
      me. Not a word more could I draw from him until we were back at
      the trainer’s house. The Colonel and the Inspector were awaiting
      us in the parlour.

      “My friend and I return to town by the night-express,” said
      Holmes. “We have had a charming little breath of your beautiful
      Dartmoor air.”

      The Inspector opened his eyes, and the Colonel’s lip curled in a
      sneer.

      “So you despair of arresting the murderer of poor Straker,” said
      he.

      Holmes shrugged his shoulders. “There are certainly grave
      difficulties in the way,” said he. “I have every hope, however,
      that your horse will start upon Tuesday, and I beg that you will
      have your jockey in readiness. Might I ask for a photograph of
      Mr. John Straker?”

      The Inspector took one from an envelope and handed it to him.

      “My dear Gregory, you anticipate all my wants. If I might ask you
      to wait here for an instant, I have a question which I should
      like to put to the maid.”

      “I must say that I am rather disappointed in our London
      consultant,” said Colonel Ross, bluntly, as my friend left the
      room. “I do not see that we are any further than when he came.”

      “At least you have his assurance that your horse will run,” said
      I.

      “Yes, I have his assurance,” said the Colonel, with a shrug of
      his shoulders. “I should prefer to have the horse.”

      I was about to make some reply in defence of my friend when he
      entered the room again.

      “Now, gentlemen,” said he, “I am quite ready for Tavistock.”

      As we stepped into the carriage one of the stable-lads held the
      door open for us. A sudden idea seemed to occur to Holmes, for he
      leaned forward and touched the lad upon the sleeve.

      “You have a few sheep in the paddock,” he said. “Who attends to
      them?”

      “I do, sir.”

      “Have you noticed anything amiss with them of late?”

      “Well, sir, not of much account; but three of them have gone
      lame, sir.”

      I could see that Holmes was extremely pleased, for he chuckled
      and rubbed his hands together.

      “A long shot, Watson; a very long shot,” said he, pinching my
      arm. “Gregory, let me recommend to your attention this singular
      epidemic among the sheep. Drive on, coachman!”

      Colonel Ross still wore an expression which showed the poor
      opinion which he had formed of my companion’s ability, but I saw
      by the Inspector’s face that his attention had been keenly
      aroused.

      “You consider that to be important?” he asked.

      “Exceedingly so.”

      “Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my
      attention?”

      “To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.”

      “The dog did nothing in the night-time.”

      “That was the curious incident,” remarked Sherlock Holmes.

      Four days later Holmes and I were again in the train, bound for
      Winchester to see the race for the Wessex Cup. Colonel Ross met
      us by appointment outside the station, and we drove in his drag
      to the course beyond the town. His face was grave, and his manner
      was cold in the extreme.

      “I have seen nothing of my horse,” said he.

      “I suppose that you would know him when you saw him?” asked
      Holmes.

      The Colonel was very angry. “I have been on the turf for twenty
      years, and never was asked such a question as that before,” said
      he. “A child would know Silver Blaze, with his white forehead and
      his mottled off-foreleg.”

      “How is the betting?”

      “Well, that is the curious part of it. You could have got fifteen
      to one yesterday, but the price has become shorter and shorter,
      until you can hardly get three to one now.”

      “Hum!” said Holmes. “Somebody knows something, that is clear.”

      As the drag drew up in the enclosure near the grand stand I
      glanced at the card to see the entries. It ran:—

      Wessex Plate. 50 sovs each h ft with 1000 sovs added for four and
      five year olds. Second, £300. Third, £200. New course (one mile
      and five furlongs).
      1. Mr. Heath Newton’s The Negro (red cap, cinnamon jacket).
      2. Colonel Wardlaw’s Pugilist (pink cap, blue and black jacket).
      3. Lord Backwater’s Desborough (yellow cap and sleeves).
      4. Colonel Ross’s Silver Blaze (black cap, red jacket).
      5. Duke of Balmoral’s Iris (yellow and black stripes).
      6. Lord Singleford’s Rasper (purple cap, black sleeves).

      “We scratched our other one, and put all hopes on your word,”
      said the Colonel. “Why, what is that? Silver Blaze favourite?”

      “Five to four against Silver Blaze!” roared the ring. “Five to
      four against Silver Blaze! Five to fifteen against Desborough!
      Five to four on the field!”

      “There are the numbers up,” I cried. “They are all six there.”

      “All six there? Then my horse is running,” cried the Colonel in
      great agitation. “But I don’t see him. My colours have not
      passed.”

      “Only five have passed. This must be he.”

      As I spoke a powerful bay horse swept out from the weighing
      enclosure and cantered past us, bearing on its back the
      well-known black and red of the Colonel.

      “That’s not my horse,” cried the owner. “That beast has not a
      white hair upon its body. What is this that you have done, Mr.
      Holmes?”

      “Well, well, let us see how he gets on,” said my friend,
      imperturbably. For a few minutes he gazed through my field-glass.
      “Capital! An excellent start!” he cried suddenly. “There they
      are, coming round the curve!”

      From our drag we had a superb view as they came up the straight.
      The six horses were so close together that a carpet could have
      covered them, but half way up the yellow of the Mapleton stable
      showed to the front. Before they reached us, however,
      Desborough’s bolt was shot, and the Colonel’s horse, coming away
      with a rush, passed the post a good six lengths before its rival,
      the Duke of Balmoral’s Iris making a bad third.

      “It’s my race, anyhow,” gasped the Colonel, passing his hand over
      his eyes. “I confess that I can make neither head nor tail of it.
      Don’t you think that you have kept up your mystery long enough,
      Mr. Holmes?”

      “Certainly, Colonel, you shall know everything. Let us all go
      round and have a look at the horse together. Here he is,” he
      continued, as we made our way into the weighing enclosure, where
      only owners and their friends find admittance. “You have only to
      wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine, and you will find
      that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever.”

      “You take my breath away!”

      “I found him in the hands of a faker, and took the liberty of
      running him just as he was sent over.”

      “My dear sir, you have done wonders. The horse looks very fit and
      well. It never went better in its life. I owe you a thousand
      apologies for having doubted your ability. You have done me a
      great service by recovering my horse. You would do me a greater
      still if you could lay your hands on the murderer of John
      Straker.”

      “I have done so,” said Holmes quietly.

      The Colonel and I stared at him in amazement. “You have got him!
      Where is he, then?”

      “He is here.”

      “Here! Where?”

      “In my company at the present moment.”

      The Colonel flushed angrily. “I quite recognise that I am under
      obligations to you, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but I must regard what
      you have just said as either a very bad joke or an insult.”

      Sherlock Holmes laughed. “I assure you that I have not associated
      you with the crime, Colonel,” said he. “The real murderer is
      standing immediately behind you.” He stepped past and laid his
      hand upon the glossy neck of the thoroughbred.

      “The horse!” cried both the Colonel and myself.

      “Yes, the horse. And it may lessen his guilt if I say that it was
      done in self-defence, and that John Straker was a man who was
      entirely unworthy of your confidence. But there goes the bell,
      and as I stand to win a little on this next race, I shall defer a
      lengthy explanation until a more fitting time.”

      We had the corner of a Pullman car to ourselves that evening as
      we whirled back to London, and I fancy that the journey was a
      short one to Colonel Ross as well as to myself, as we listened to
      our companion’s narrative of the events which had occurred at the
      Dartmoor training-stables upon the Monday night, and the means by
      which he had unravelled them.

      “I confess,” said he, “that any theories which I had formed from
      the newspaper reports were entirely erroneous. And yet there were
      indications there, had they not been overlaid by other details
      which concealed their true import. I went to Devonshire with the
      conviction that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although,
      of course, I saw that the evidence against him was by no means
      complete. It was while I was in the carriage, just as we reached
      the trainer’s house, that the immense significance of the curried
      mutton occurred to me. You may remember that I was distrait, and
      remained sitting after you had all alighted. I was marvelling in
      my own mind how I could possibly have overlooked so obvious a
      clue.”

      “I confess,” said the Colonel, “that even now I cannot see how it
      helps us.”

      “It was the first link in my chain of reasoning. Powdered opium
      is by no means tasteless. The flavour is not disagreeable, but it
      is perceptible. Were it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater
      would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. A
      curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. By
      no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson,
      have caused curry to be served in the trainer’s family that
      night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose
      that he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very
      night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the
      flavour. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes
      eliminated from the case, and our attention centres upon Straker
      and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried
      mutton for supper that night. The opium was added after the dish
      was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for
      supper with no ill effects. Which of them, then, had access to
      that dish without the maid seeing them?

      “Before deciding that question I had grasped the significance of
      the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably
      suggests others. The Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was
      kept in the stables, and yet, though some one had been in and had
      fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two
      lads in the loft. Obviously the midnight visitor was some one
      whom the dog knew well.

      “I was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker
      went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out
      Silver Blaze. For what purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously,
      or why should he drug his own stable-boy? And yet I was at a loss
      to know why. There have been cases before now where trainers have
      made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own
      horses, through agents, and then preventing them from winning by
      fraud. Sometimes it is a pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some
      surer and subtler means. What was it here? I hoped that the
      contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.

      “And they did so. You cannot have forgotten the singular knife
      which was found in the dead man’s hand, a knife which certainly
      no sane man would choose for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Watson told
      us, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate
      operations known in surgery. And it was to be used for a delicate
      operation that night. You must know, with your wide experience of
      turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight
      nick upon the tendons of a horse’s ham, and to do it
      subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace. A horse so
      treated would develop a slight lameness, which would be put down
      to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to
      foul play.”

      “Villain! Scoundrel!” cried the Colonel.

      “We have here the explanation of why John Straker wished to take
      the horse out on to the moor. So spirited a creature would have
      certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick
      of the knife. It was absolutely necessary to do it in the open
      air.”

      “I have been blind!” cried the Colonel. “Of course that was why
      he needed the candle, and struck the match.”

      “Undoubtedly. But in examining his belongings I was fortunate
      enough to discover not only the method of the crime, but even its
      motives. As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not
      carry other people’s bills about in their pockets. We have most
      of us quite enough to do to settle our own. I at once concluded
      that Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second
      establishment. The nature of the bill showed that there was a
      lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as
      you are with your servants, one can hardly expect that they can
      buy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their ladies. I questioned
      Mrs. Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having
      satisfied myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of
      the milliner’s address, and felt that by calling there with
      Straker’s photograph I could easily dispose of the mythical
      Derbyshire.

      “From that time on all was plain. Straker had led out the horse
      to a hollow where his light would be invisible. Simpson in his
      flight had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it up—with
      some idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse’s
      leg. Once in the hollow, he had got behind the horse and had
      struck a light; but the creature frightened at the sudden glare,
      and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some
      mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had
      struck Straker full on the forehead. He had already, in spite of
      the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate
      task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh. Do I make
      it clear?”

      “Wonderful!” cried the Colonel. “Wonderful! You might have been
      there!”

      “My final shot was, I confess a very long one. It struck me that
      so astute a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate
      tendon-nicking without a little practice. What could he practice
      on? My eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked a question which,
      rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct.

      “When I returned to London I called upon the milliner, who had
      recognised Straker as an excellent customer of the name of
      Derbyshire, who had a very dashing wife, with a strong partiality
      for expensive dresses. I have no doubt that this woman had
      plunged him over head and ears in debt, and so led him into this
      miserable plot.”

      “You have explained all but one thing,” cried the Colonel. “Where
      was the horse?”

      “Ah, it bolted, and was cared for by one of your neighbours. We
      must have an amnesty in that direction, I think. This is Clapham
      Junction, if I am not mistaken, and we shall be in Victoria in
      less than ten minutes. If you care to smoke a cigar in our rooms,
      Colonel, I shall be happy to give you any other details which
      might interest you.”




II. The Adventure of the Cardboard Box


      In choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable
      mental qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have
      endeavoured, as far as possible, to select those which presented
      the minimum of sensationalism, while offering a fair field for
      his talents. It is, however, unfortunately impossible entirely to
      separate the sensational from the criminal, and a chronicler is
      left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which
      are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of
      the problem, or he must use matter which chance, and not choice,
      has provided him with. With this short preface I shall turn to my
      notes of what proved to be a strange, though a peculiarly
      terrible, chain of events.

      It was a blazing hot day in August. Baker Street was like an
      oven, and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of
      the house across the road was painful to the eye. It was hard to
      believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily
      through the fogs of winter. Our blinds were half-drawn, and
      Holmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter
      which he had received by the morning post. For myself, my term of
      service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold,
      and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship. But the morning
      paper was uninteresting. Parliament had risen. Everybody was out
      of town, and I yearned for the glades of the New Forest or the
      shingle of Southsea. A depleted bank account had caused me to
      postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the country
      nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him. He loved
      to lie in the very centre of five millions of people, with his
      filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to
      every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime. Appreciation
      of nature found no place among his many gifts, and his only
      change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town
      to track down his brother of the country.

      Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had
      tossed aside the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I
      fell into a brown study. Suddenly my companion’s voice broke in
      upon my thoughts:

      “You are right, Watson,” said he. “It does seem a most
      preposterous way of settling a dispute.”

      “Most preposterous!” I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how
      he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair
      and stared at him in blank amazement.

      “What is this, Holmes?” I cried. “This is beyond anything which I
      could have imagined.”

      He laughed heartily at my perplexity.

      “You remember,” he said, “that some little time ago when I read
      you the passage in one of Poe’s sketches in which a close
      reasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were
      inclined to treat the matter as a mere _tour-de-force_ of the
      author. On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of
      doing the same thing you expressed incredulity.”

      “Oh, no!”

      “Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with
      your eyebrows. So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter
      upon a train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity
      of reading it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof
      that I had been in rapport with you.”

      But I was still far from satisfied. “In the example which you
      read to me,” said I, “the reasoner drew his conclusions from the
      actions of the man whom he observed. If I remember right, he
      stumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so
      on. But I have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clues
      can I have given you?”

      “You do yourself an injustice. The features are given to man as
      the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are
      faithful servants.”

      “Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my
      features?”

      “Your features and especially your eyes. Perhaps you cannot
      yourself recall how your reverie commenced?”

      “No, I cannot.”

      “Then I will tell you. After throwing down your paper, which was
      the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a
      minute with a vacant expression. Then your eyes fixed themselves
      upon your newly framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by
      the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been
      started. But it did not lead very far. Your eyes flashed across
      to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon
      the top of your books. Then you glanced up at the wall, and of
      course your meaning was obvious. You were thinking that if the
      portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and
      correspond with Gordon’s picture over there.”

      “You have followed me wonderfully!” I exclaimed.

      “So far I could hardly have gone astray. But now your thoughts
      went back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were
      studying the character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to
      pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was
      thoughtful. You were recalling the incidents of Beecher’s career.
      I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of
      the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time
      of the Civil War, for I remember your expressing your passionate
      indignation at the way in which he was received by the more
      turbulent of our people. You felt so strongly about it that I
      knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that
      also. When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the
      picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil
      War, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled,
      and your hands clenched I was positive that you were indeed
      thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that
      desperate struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder; you
      shook your head. You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror
      and useless waste of life. Your hand stole towards your own old
      wound and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the
      ridiculous side of this method of settling international
      questions had forced itself upon your mind. At this point I
      agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to find
      that all my deductions had been correct.”

      “Absolutely!” said I. “And now that you have explained it, I
      confess that I am as amazed as before.”

      “It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you. I should
      not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some
      incredulity the other day. But I have in my hands here a little
      problem which may prove to be more difficult of solution than my
      small essay in thought reading. Have you observed in the paper a
      short paragraph referring to the remarkable contents of a packet
      sent through the post to Miss Cushing, of Cross Street, Croydon?”

      “No, I saw nothing.”

      “Ah! then you must have overlooked it. Just toss it over to me.
      Here it is, under the financial column. Perhaps you would be good
      enough to read it aloud.”

      I picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the
      paragraph indicated. It was headed, “A Gruesome Packet.”

      “Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been
      made the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly
      revolting practical joke unless some more sinister meaning should
      prove to be attached to the incident. At two o’clock yesterday
      afternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in
      by the postman. A cardboard box was inside, which was filled with
      coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss Cushing was horrified to find
      two human ears, apparently quite freshly severed. The box had
      been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the morning before.
      There is no indication as to the sender, and the matter is the
      more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of fifty,
      has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or
      correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive
      anything through the post. Some years ago, however, when she
      resided at Penge, she let apartments in her house to three young
      medical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account
      of their noisy and irregular habits. The police are of opinion
      that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by
      these youths, who owed her a grudge and who hoped to frighten her
      by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms. Some
      probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these
      students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the best of Miss
      Cushing’s belief, from Belfast. In the meantime, the matter is
      being actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very
      smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.”

      “So much for the _Daily Chronicle_,” said Holmes as I finished
      reading. “Now for our friend Lestrade. I had a note from him this
      morning, in which he says: ‘I think that this case is very much
      in your line. We have every hope of clearing the matter up, but
      we find a little difficulty in getting anything to work upon. We
      have, of course, wired to the Belfast post-office, but a large
      number of parcels were handed in upon that day, and they have no
      means of identifying this particular one, or of remembering the
      sender. The box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does
      not help us in any way. The medical student theory still appears
      to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a few hours
      to spare I should be very happy to see you out here. I shall be
      either at the house or in the police-station all day.’ What say
      you, Watson? Can you rise superior to the heat and run down to
      Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?”

      “I was longing for something to do.”

      “You shall have it then. Ring for our boots and tell them to
      order a cab. I’ll be back in a moment when I have changed my
      dressing-gown and filled my cigar-case.”

      A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat
      was far less oppressive in Croydon than in town. Holmes had sent
      on a wire, so that Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as
      ferret-like as ever, was waiting for us at the station. A walk of
      five minutes took us to Cross Street, where Miss Cushing resided.

      It was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and
      prim, with whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned
      women gossiping at the doors. Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and
      tapped at a door, which was opened by a small servant girl. Miss
      Cushing was sitting in the front room, into which we were
      ushered. She was a placid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes,
      and grizzled hair curving down over her temples on each side. A
      worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a basket of coloured
      silks stood upon a stool beside her.

      “They are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,” said she as
      Lestrade entered. “I wish that you would take them away
      altogether.”

      “So I shall, Miss Cushing. I only kept them here until my friend,
      Mr. Holmes, should have seen them in your presence.”

      “Why in my presence, sir?”

      “In case he wished to ask any questions.”

      “What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know
      nothing whatever about it?”

      “Quite so, madam,” said Holmes in his soothing way. “I have no
      doubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over
      this business.”

      “Indeed, I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and live a retired life.
      It is something new for me to see my name in the papers and to
      find the police in my house. I won’t have those things in here,
      Mr. Lestrade. If you wish to see them you must go to the
      outhouse.”

      It was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the
      house. Lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box,
      with a piece of brown paper and some string. There was a bench at
      the end of the path, and we all sat down while Holmes examined,
      one by one, the articles which Lestrade had handed to him.

      “The string is exceedingly interesting,” he remarked, holding it
      up to the light and sniffing at it. “What do you make of this
      string, Lestrade?”

      “It has been tarred.”

      “Precisely. It is a piece of tarred twine. You have also, no
      doubt, remarked that Miss Cushing has cut the cord with a
      scissors, as can be seen by the double fray on each side. This is
      of importance.”

      “I cannot see the importance,” said Lestrade.

      “The importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact,
      and that this knot is of a peculiar character.”

      “It is very neatly tied. I had already made a note to that
      effect,” said Lestrade complacently.

      “So much for the string, then,” said Holmes, smiling, “now for
      the box wrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee.
      What, did you not observe it? I think there can be no doubt of
      it. Address printed in rather straggling characters: ‘Miss S.
      Cushing, Cross Street, Croydon.’ Done with a broad-pointed pen,
      probably a J, and with very inferior ink. The word ‘Croydon’ has
      been originally spelled with an ‘i,’ which has been changed to
      ‘y.’ The parcel was directed, then, by a man—the printing is
      distinctly masculine—of limited education and unacquainted with
      the town of Croydon. So far, so good! The box is a yellow
      half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two thumb
      marks at the left bottom corner. It is filled with rough salt of
      the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser
      commercial purposes. And embedded in it are these very singular
      enclosures.”

      He took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across
      his knee he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending
      forward on each side of him, glanced alternately at these
      dreadful relics and at the thoughtful, eager face of our
      companion. Finally he returned them to the box once more and sat
      for a while in deep meditation.

      “You have observed, of course,” said he at last, “that the ears
      are not a pair.”

      “Yes, I have noticed that. But if this were the practical joke of
      some students from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for
      them to send two odd ears as a pair.”

      “Precisely. But this is not a practical joke.”

      “You are sure of it?”

      “The presumption is strongly against it. Bodies in the
      dissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid. These ears
      bear no signs of this. They are fresh, too. They have been cut
      off with a blunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a
      student had done it. Again, carbolic or rectified spirits would
      be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the
      medical mind, certainly not rough salt. I repeat that there is no
      practical joke here, but that we are investigating a serious
      crime.”

      A vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion’s
      words and saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features.
      This brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and
      inexplicable horror in the background. Lestrade, however, shook
      his head like a man who is only half convinced.

      “There are objections to the joke theory, no doubt,” said he,
      “but there are much stronger reasons against the other. We know
      that this woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at
      Penge and here for the last twenty years. She has hardly been
      away from her home for a day during that time. Why on earth,
      then, should any criminal send her the proofs of his guilt,
      especially as, unless she is a most consummate actress, she
      understands quite as little of the matter as we do?”

      “That is the problem which we have to solve,” Holmes answered,
      “and for my part I shall set about it by presuming that my
      reasoning is correct, and that a double murder has been
      committed. One of these ears is a woman’s, small, finely formed,
      and pierced for an earring. The other is a man’s, sun-burned,
      discoloured, and also pierced for an earring. These two people
      are presumably dead, or we should have heard their story before
      now. To-day is Friday. The packet was posted on Thursday morning.
      The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday or earlier.
      If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would
      have sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing? We may take it
      that the sender of the packet is the man whom we want. But he
      must have some strong reason for sending Miss Cushing this
      packet. What reason then? It must have been to tell her that the
      deed was done! or to pain her, perhaps. But in that case she
      knows who it is. Does she know? I doubt it. If she knew, why
      should she call the police in? She might have buried the ears,
      and no one would have been the wiser. That is what she would have
      done if she had wished to shield the criminal. But if she does
      not wish to shield him she would give his name. There is a tangle
      here which needs straightening out.” He had been talking in a
      high, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but
      now he sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house.

      “I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,” said he.

      “In that case I may leave you here,” said Lestrade, “for I have
      another small business on hand. I think that I have nothing
      further to learn from Miss Cushing. You will find me at the
      police-station.”

      “We shall look in on our way to the train,” answered Holmes. A
      moment later he and I were back in the front room, where the
      impassive lady was still quietly working away at her
      antimacassar. She put it down on her lap as we entered and looked
      at us with her frank, searching blue eyes.

      “I am convinced, sir,” she said, “that this matter is a mistake,
      and that the parcel was never meant for me at all. I have said
      this several times to the gentleman from Scotland Yard, but he
      simply laughs at me. I have not an enemy in the world, as far as
      I know, so why should anyone play me such a trick?”

      “I am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing,” said
      Holmes, taking a seat beside her. “I think that it is more than
      probable——” he paused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to
      see that he was staring with singular intentness at the lady’s
      profile. Surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to be
      read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to find
      out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever. I
      stared hard myself at her flat, grizzled hair, her trim cap, her
      little gilt earrings, her placid features; but I could see
      nothing which could account for my companion’s evident
      excitement.

      “There were one or two questions——”

      “Oh, I am weary of questions!” cried Miss Cushing impatiently.

      “You have two sisters, I believe.”

      “How could you know that?”

      “I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you
      have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece, one
      of whom is undoubtedly yourself, while the others are so
      exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the
      relationship.”

      “Yes, you are quite right. Those are my sisters, Sarah and Mary.”

      “And here at my elbow is another portrait, taken at Liverpool, of
      your younger sister, in the company of a man who appears to be a
      steward by his uniform. I observe that she was unmarried at the
      time.”

      “You are very quick at observing.”

      “That is my trade.”

      “Well, you are quite right. But she was married to Mr. Browner a
      few days afterwards. He was on the South American line when that
      was taken, but he was so fond of her that he couldn’t abide to
      leave her for so long, and he got into the Liverpool and London
      boats.”

      “Ah, the _Conqueror_, perhaps?”

      “No, the _May Day_, when last I heard. Jim came down here to see
      me once. That was before he broke the pledge; but afterwards he
      would always take drink when he was ashore, and a little drink
      would send him stark, staring mad. Ah! it was a bad day that ever
      he took a glass in his hand again. First he dropped me, then he
      quarrelled with Sarah, and now that Mary has stopped writing we
      don’t know how things are going with them.”

      It was evident that Miss Cushing had come upon a subject on which
      she felt very deeply. Like most people who lead a lonely life,
      she was shy at first, but ended by becoming extremely
      communicative. She told us many details about her brother-in-law
      the steward, and then wandering off on the subject of her former
      lodgers, the medical students, she gave us a long account of
      their delinquencies, with their names and those of their
      hospitals. Holmes listened attentively to everything, throwing in
      a question from time to time.

      “About your second sister, Sarah,” said he. “I wonder, since you
      are both maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.”

      “Ah! you don’t know Sarah’s temper or you would wonder no more. I
      tried it when I came to Croydon, and we kept on until about two
      months ago, when we had to part. I don’t want to say a word
      against my own sister, but she was always meddlesome and hard to
      please, was Sarah.”

      “You say that she quarrelled with your Liverpool relations.”

      “Yes, and they were the best of friends at one time. Why, she
      went up there to live in order to be near them. And now she has
      no word hard enough for Jim Browner. The last six months that she
      was here she would speak of nothing but his drinking and his
      ways. He had caught her meddling, I suspect, and given her a bit
      of his mind, and that was the start of it.”

      “Thank you, Miss Cushing,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Your
      sister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street Wallington?
      Good-bye, and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled
      over a case with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to
      do.”

      There was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it.

      “How far to Wallington?” he asked.

      “Only about a mile, sir.”

      “Very good. Jump in, Watson. We must strike while the iron is
      hot. Simple as the case is, there have been one or two very
      instructive details in connection with it. Just pull up at a
      telegraph office as you pass, cabby.”

      Holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay
      back in the cab, with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the
      sun from his face. Our driver pulled up at a house which was not
      unlike the one which we had just quitted. My companion ordered
      him to wait, and had his hand upon the knocker, when the door
      opened and a grave young gentleman in black, with a very shiny
      hat, appeared on the step.

      “Is Miss Cushing at home?” asked Holmes.

      “Miss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,” said he. “She has been
      suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity.
      As her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility
      of allowing anyone to see her. I should recommend you to call
      again in ten days.” He drew on his gloves, closed the door, and
      marched off down the street.

      “Well, if we can’t we can’t,” said Holmes, cheerfully.

      “Perhaps she could not or would not have told you much.”

      “I did not wish her to tell me anything. I only wanted to look at
      her. However, I think that I have got all that I want. Drive us
      to some decent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and
      afterwards we shall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the
      police-station.”

      We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would
      talk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation
      how he had purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at
      least five hundred guineas, at a Jew broker’s in Tottenham Court
      Road for fifty-five shillings. This led him to Paganini, and we
      sat for an hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote
      after anecdote of that extraordinary man. The afternoon was far
      advanced and the hot glare had softened into a mellow glow before
      we found ourselves at the police-station. Lestrade was waiting
      for us at the door.

      “A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,” said he.

      “Ha! It is the answer!” He tore it open, glanced his eyes over
      it, and crumpled it into his pocket. “That’s all right,” said he.

      “Have you found out anything?”

      “I have found out everything!”

      “What!” Lestrade stared at him in amazement. “You are joking.”

      “I was never more serious in my life. A shocking crime has been
      committed, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it.”

      “And the criminal?”

      Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting
      cards and threw it over to Lestrade.

      “That is the name,” he said. “You cannot effect an arrest until
      to-morrow night at the earliest. I should prefer that you do not
      mention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose
      to be only associated with those crimes which present some
      difficulty in their solution. Come on, Watson.” We strode off
      together to the station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a
      delighted face at the card which Holmes had thrown him.

      “The case,” said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over our cigars
      that night in our rooms at Baker Street, “is one where, as in the
      investigations which you have chronicled under the names of ‘A
      Study in Scarlet’ and of ‘The Sign of Four,’ we have been
      compelled to reason backward from effects to causes. I have
      written to Lestrade asking him to supply us with the details
      which are now wanting, and which he will only get after he has
      secured his man. That he may be safely trusted to do, for
      although he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as tenacious as
      a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and,
      indeed, it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top
      at Scotland Yard.”

      “Your case is not complete, then?” I asked.

      “It is fairly complete in essentials. We know who the author of
      the revolting business is, although one of the victims still
      escapes us. Of course, you have formed your own conclusions.”

      “I presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool
      boat, is the man whom you suspect?”

      “Oh! it is more than a suspicion.”

      “And yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.”

      “On the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear. Let me
      run over the principal steps. We approached the case, you
      remember, with an absolutely blank mind, which is always an
      advantage. We had formed no theories. We were simply there to
      observe and to draw inferences from our observations. What did we
      see first? A very placid and respectable lady, who seemed quite
      innocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed me that she
      had two younger sisters. It instantly flashed across my mind that
      the box might have been meant for one of these. I set the idea
      aside as one which could be disproved or confirmed at our
      leisure. Then we went to the garden, as you remember, and we saw
      the very singular contents of the little yellow box.

      “The string was of the quality which is used by sailmakers aboard
      ship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our
      investigation. When I observed that the knot was one which is
      popular with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a port,
      and that the male ear was pierced for an earring which is so much
      more common among sailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that
      all the actors in the tragedy were to be found among our
      seafaring classes.

      “When I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that
      it was to Miss S. Cushing. Now, the oldest sister would, of
      course, be Miss Cushing, and although her initial was ‘S’ it
      might belong to one of the others as well. In that case we should
      have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis altogether.
      I therefore went into the house with the intention of clearing up
      this point. I was about to assure Miss Cushing that I was
      convinced that a mistake had been made when you may remember that
      I came suddenly to a stop. The fact was that I had just seen
      something which filled me with surprise and at the same time
      narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.

      “As a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part
      of the body which varies so much as the human ear. Each ear is as
      a rule quite distinctive and differs from all other ones. In last
      year’s _Anthropological Journal_ you will find two short
      monographs from my pen upon the subject. I had, therefore,
      examined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert and had
      carefully noted their anatomical peculiarities. Imagine my
      surprise, then, when on looking at Miss Cushing I perceived that
      her ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which I had just
      inspected. The matter was entirely beyond coincidence. There was
      the same shortening of the pinna, the same broad curve of the
      upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner cartilage. In all
      essentials it was the same ear.

      “Of course I at once saw the enormous importance of the
      observation. It was evident that the victim was a blood relation
      and probably a very close one. I began to talk to her about her
      family, and you remember that she at once gave us some
      exceedingly valuable details.

      “In the first place, her sister’s name was Sarah, and her address
      had until recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious
      how the mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant.
      Then we heard of this steward, married to the third sister, and
      learned that he had at one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah
      that she had actually gone up to Liverpool to be near the
      Browners, but a quarrel had afterwards divided them. This quarrel
      had put a stop to all communications for some months, so that if
      Browner had occasion to address a packet to Miss Sarah, he would
      undoubtedly have done so to her old address.

      “And now the matter had begun to straighten itself out
      wonderfully. We had learned of the existence of this steward, an
      impulsive man, of strong passions—you remember that he threw up
      what must have been a very superior berth in order to be nearer
      to his wife—subject, too, to occasional fits of hard drinking. We
      had reason to believe that his wife had been murdered, and that a
      man—presumably a seafaring man—had been murdered at the same
      time. Jealousy, of course, at once suggests itself as the motive
      for the crime. And why should these proofs of the deed be sent to
      Miss Sarah Cushing? Probably because during her residence in
      Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events which
      led to the tragedy. You will observe that this line of boats
      calls at Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presuming that
      Browner had committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his
      steamer, the _May Day_, Belfast would be the first place at which
      he could post his terrible packet.

      “A second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and
      although I thought it exceedingly unlikely, I was determined to
      elucidate it before going further. An unsuccessful lover might
      have killed Mr. and Mrs. Browner, and the male ear might have
      belonged to the husband. There were many grave objections to this
      theory, but it was conceivable. I therefore sent off a telegram
      to my friend Algar, of the Liverpool force, and asked him to find
      out if Mrs. Browner were at home, and if Browner had departed in
      the _May Day_. Then we went on to Wallington to visit Miss Sarah.

      “I was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear
      had been reproduced in her. Then, of course, she might give us
      very important information, but I was not sanguine that she
      would. She must have heard of the business the day before, since
      all Croydon was ringing with it, and she alone could have
      understood for whom the packet was meant. If she had been willing
      to help justice she would probably have communicated with the
      police already. However, it was clearly our duty to see her, so
      we went. We found that the news of the arrival of the packet—for
      her illness dated from that time—had such an effect upon her as
      to bring on brain fever. It was clearer than ever that she
      understood its full significance, but equally clear that we
      should have to wait some time for any assistance from her.

      “However, we were really independent of her help. Our answers
      were waiting for us at the police-station, where I had directed
      Algar to send them. Nothing could be more conclusive. Mrs.
      Browner’s house had been closed for more than three days, and the
      neighbours were of opinion that she had gone south to see her
      relatives. It had been ascertained at the shipping offices that
      Browner had left aboard of the _May Day_, and I calculate that
      she is due in the Thames to-morrow night. When he arrives he will
      be met by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade, and I have no doubt
      that we shall have all our details filled in.”

      Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations. Two
      days later he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short
      note from the detective, and a typewritten document, which
      covered several pages of foolscap.

      “Lestrade has got him all right,” said Holmes, glancing up at me.
      “Perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says.

      “My dear Mr. Holmes,—In accordance with the scheme which we had
      formed in order to test our theories”—“the ‘we’ is rather fine,
      Watson, is it not?”—“I went down to the Albert Dock yesterday at
      6 P.M., and boarded the S.S. _May Day_, belonging to the
      Liverpool, Dublin, and London Steam Packet Company. On inquiry, I
      found that there was a steward on board of the name of James
      Browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such an
      extraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to
      relieve him of his duties. On descending to his berth, I found
      him seated upon a chest with his head sunk upon his hands,
      rocking himself to and fro. He is a big, powerful chap,
      clean-shaven, and very swarthy— something like Aldridge, who
      helped us in the bogus laundry affair. He jumped up when he heard
      my business, and I had my whistle to my lips to call a couple of
      river police, who were round the corner, but he seemed to have no
      heart in him, and he held out his hands quietly enough for the
      darbies. We brought him along to the cells, and his box as well,
      for we thought there might be something incriminating; but, bar a
      big sharp knife such as most sailors have, we got nothing for our
      trouble. However, we find that we shall want no more evidence,
      for on being brought before the inspector at the station he asked
      leave to make a statement, which was, of course, taken down, just
      as he made it, by our shorthand man. We had three copies
      typewritten, one of which I enclose. The affair proves, as I
      always thought it would, to be an extremely simple one, but I am
      obliged to you for assisting me in my investigation. With kind
      regards, yours very truly,—G. Lestrade.”

      “Hum! The investigation really was a very simple one,” remarked
      Holmes, “but I don’t think it struck him in that light when he
      first called us in. However, let us see what Jim Browner has to
      say for himself. This is his statement as made before Inspector
      Montgomery at the Shadwell Police Station, and it has the
      advantage of being verbatim.”

      “Have I anything to say? Yes, I have a deal to say. I have to
      make a clean breast of it all. You can hang me, or you can leave
      me alone. I don’t care a plug which you do. I tell you I’ve not
      shut an eye in sleep since I did it, and I don’t believe I ever
      will again until I get past all waking. Sometimes it’s his face,
      but most generally it’s hers. I’m never without one or the other
      before me. He looks frowning and black-like, but she has a kind
      o’ surprise upon her face. Ay, the white lamb, she might well be
      surprised when she read death on a face that had seldom looked
      anything but love upon her before.

      “But it was Sarah’s fault, and may the curse of a broken man put
      a blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins! It’s not
      that I want to clear myself. I know that I went back to drink,
      like the beast that I was. But she would have forgiven me; she
      would have stuck as close to me as a rope to a block if that
      woman had never darkened our door. For Sarah Cushing loved
      me—that’s the root of the business—she loved me until all her
      love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that I thought more
      of my wife’s footmark in the mud than I did of her whole body and
      soul.

      “There were three sisters altogether. The old one was just a good
      woman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel. Sarah
      was thirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married. We
      were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house
      together, and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my
      Mary. And then we asked Sarah up for a week, and the week grew
      into a month, and one thing led to another, until she was just
      one of ourselves.

      “I was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little
      money by, and all was as bright as a new dollar. My God, whoever
      would have thought that it could have come to this? Whoever would
      have dreamed it?

      “I used to be home for the week-ends very often, and sometimes if
      the ship were held back for cargo I would have a whole week at a
      time, and in this way I saw a deal of my sister-in-law, Sarah.
      She was a fine tall woman, black and quick and fierce, with a
      proud way of carrying her head, and a glint from her eye like a
      spark from a flint. But when little Mary was there I had never a
      thought of her, and that I swear as I hope for God’s mercy.

      “It had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with
      me, or to coax me out for a walk with her, but I had never
      thought anything of that. But one evening my eyes were opened. I
      had come up from the ship and found my wife out, but Sarah at
      home. ‘Where’s Mary?’ I asked. ‘Oh, she has gone to pay some
      accounts.’ I was impatient and paced up and down the room. ‘Can’t
      you be happy for five minutes without Mary, Jim?’ says she. ‘It’s
      a bad compliment to me that you can’t be contented with my
      society for so short a time.’ ‘That’s all right, my lass,’ said
      I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she had
      it in both hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in
      a fever. I looked into her eyes and I read it all there. There
      was no need for her to speak, nor for me either. I frowned and
      drew my hand away. Then she stood by my side in silence for a
      bit, and then put up her hand and patted me on the shoulder.
      ‘Steady old Jim!’ said she, and with a kind o’ mocking laugh, she
      ran out of the room.

      “Well, from that time Sarah hated me with her whole heart and
      soul, and she is a woman who can hate, too. I was a fool to let
      her go on biding with us—a besotted fool—but I never said a word
      to Mary, for I knew it would grieve her. Things went on much as
      before, but after a time I began to find that there was a bit of
      a change in Mary herself. She had always been so trusting and so
      innocent, but now she became queer and suspicious, wanting to
      know where I had been and what I had been doing, and whom my
      letters were from, and what I had in my pockets, and a thousand
      such follies. Day by day she grew queerer and more irritable, and
      we had ceaseless rows about nothing. I was fairly puzzled by it
      all. Sarah avoided me now, but she and Mary were just
      inseparable. I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and
      poisoning my wife’s mind against me, but I was such a blind
      beetle that I could not understand it at the time. Then I broke
      my blue ribbon and began to drink again, but I think I should not
      have done it if Mary had been the same as ever. She had some
      reason to be disgusted with me now, and the gap between us began
      to be wider and wider. And then this Alec Fairbairn chipped in,
      and things became a thousand times blacker.

      “It was to see Sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it
      was to see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made
      friends wherever he went. He was a dashing, swaggering chap,
      smart and curled, who had seen half the world and could talk of
      what he had seen. He was good company, I won’t deny it, and he
      had wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man, so that I
      think there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop
      than the forecastle. For a month he was in and out of my house,
      and never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his
      soft, tricky ways. And then at last something made me suspect,
      and from that day my peace was gone forever.

      “It was only a little thing, too. I had come into the parlour
      unexpected, and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of
      welcome on my wife’s face. But as she saw who it was it faded
      again, and she turned away with a look of disappointment. That
      was enough for me. There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step
      she could have mistaken for mine. If I could have seen him then I
      should have killed him, for I have always been like a madman when
      my temper gets loose. Mary saw the devil’s light in my eyes, and
      she ran forward with her hands on my sleeve. ‘Don’t, Jim, don’t!’
      says she. ‘Where’s Sarah?’ I asked. ‘In the kitchen,’ says she.
      ‘Sarah,’ says I as I went in, ‘this man Fairbairn is never to
      darken my door again.’ ‘Why not?’ says she. ‘Because I order it.’
      ‘Oh!’ says she, ‘if my friends are not good enough for this
      house, then I am not good enough for it either.’ ‘You can do what
      you like,’ says I, ‘but if Fairbairn shows his face here again
      I’ll send you one of his ears for a keepsake.’ She was frightened
      by my face, I think, for she never answered a word, and the same
      evening she left my house.

      “Well, I don’t know now whether it was pure devilry on the part
      of this woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me
      against my wife by encouraging her to misbehave. Anyway, she took
      a house just two streets off and let lodgings to sailors.
      Fairbairn used to stay there, and Mary would go round to have tea
      with her sister and him. How often she went I don’t know, but I
      followed her one day, and as I broke in at the door Fairbairn got
      away over the back garden wall, like the cowardly skunk that he
      was. I swore to my wife that I would kill her if I found her in
      his company again, and I led her back with me, sobbing and
      trembling, and as white as a piece of paper. There was no trace
      of love between us any longer. I could see that she hated me and
      feared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she
      despised me as well.

      “Well, Sarah found that she could not make a living in Liverpool,
      so she went back, as I understand, to live with her sister in
      Croydon, and things jogged on much the same as ever at home. And
      then came this last week and all the misery and ruin.

      “It was in this way. We had gone on the _May Day_ for a round
      voyage of seven days, but a hogshead got loose and started one of
      our plates, so that we had to put back into port for twelve
      hours. I left the ship and came home, thinking what a surprise it
      would be for my wife, and hoping that maybe she would be glad to
      see me so soon. The thought was in my head as I turned into my
      own street, and at that moment a cab passed me, and there she
      was, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two chatting and
      laughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching them
      from the footpath.

      “I tell you, and I give you my word for it, that from that moment
      I was not my own master, and it is all like a dim dream when I
      look back on it. I had been drinking hard of late, and the two
      things together fairly turned my brain. There’s something
      throbbing in my head now, like a docker’s hammer, but that
      morning I seemed to have all Niagara whizzing and buzzing in my
      ears.

      “Well, I took to my heels, and I ran after the cab. I had a heavy
      oak stick in my hand, and I tell you I saw red from the first;
      but as I ran I got cunning, too, and hung back a little to see
      them without being seen. They pulled up soon at the railway
      station. There was a good crowd round the booking-office, so I
      got quite close to them without being seen. They took tickets for
      New Brighton. So did I, but I got in three carriages behind them.
      When we reached it they walked along the Parade, and I was never
      more than a hundred yards from them. At last I saw them hire a
      boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot day, and they
      thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water.

      “It was just as if they had been given into my hands. There was a
      bit of a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred
      yards. I hired a boat for myself, and I pulled after them. I
      could see the blur of their craft, but they were going nearly as
      fast as I, and they must have been a long mile from the shore
      before I caught them up. The haze was like a curtain all round
      us, and there were we three in the middle of it. My God, shall I
      ever forget their faces when they saw who was in the boat that
      was closing in upon them? She screamed out. He swore like a
      madman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death
      in my eyes. I got past it and got one in with my stick that
      crushed his head like an egg. I would have spared her, perhaps,
      for all my madness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out
      to him, and calling him ‘Alec.’ I struck again, and she lay
      stretched beside him. I was like a wild beast then that had
      tasted blood. If Sarah had been there, by the Lord, she should
      have joined them. I pulled out my knife, and—well, there! I’ve
      said enough. It gave me a kind of savage joy when I thought how
      Sarah would feel when she had such signs as these of what her
      meddling had brought about. Then I tied the bodies into the boat,
      stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk. I knew very well
      that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings in
      the haze, and had drifted off out to sea. I cleaned myself up,
      got back to land, and joined my ship without a soul having a
      suspicion of what had passed. That night I made up the packet for
      Sarah Cushing, and next day I sent it from Belfast.

      “There you have the whole truth of it. You can hang me, or do
      what you like with me, but you cannot punish me as I have been
      punished already. I cannot shut my eyes but I see those two faces
      staring at me—staring at me as they stared when my boat broke
      through the haze. I killed them quick, but they are killing me
      slow; and if I have another night of it I shall be either mad or
      dead before morning. You won’t put me alone into a cell, sir? For
      pity’s sake don’t, and may you be treated in your day of agony as
      you treat me now.’

      “What is the meaning of it, Watson?” said Holmes solemnly as he
      laid down the paper. “What object is served by this circle of
      misery and violence and fear? It must tend to some end, or else
      our universe is ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. But what
      end? There is the great standing perennial problem to which human
      reason is as far from an answer as ever.”




III. The Yellow Face


      In publishing these short sketches based upon the numerous cases
      in which my companion’s singular gifts have made us the listeners
      to, and eventually the actors in, some strange drama, it is only
      natural that I should dwell rather upon his successes than upon
      his failures. And this not so much for the sake of his
      reputation—for, indeed, it was when he was at his wits’ end that
      his energy and his versatility were most admirable—but because
      where he failed it happened too often that no one else succeeded,
      and that the tale was left forever without a conclusion. Now and
      again, however, it chanced that even when he erred, the truth was
      still discovered. I have noted of some half-dozen cases of the
      kind, of which the Affair of the Second Stain and that which I am
      now about to recount are the two which present the strongest
      features of interest.

      Sherlock Holmes was a man who seldom took exercise for exercise’s
      sake. Few men were capable of greater muscular effort, and he was
      undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have
      ever seen; but he looked upon aimless bodily exertion as a waste
      of energy, and he seldom bestirred himself save when there was
      some professional object to be served. Then he was absolutely
      untiring and indefatigable. That he should have kept himself in
      training under such circumstances is remarkable, but his diet was
      usually of the sparest, and his habits were simple to the verge
      of austerity. Save for the occasional use of cocaine, he had no
      vices, and he only turned to the drug as a protest against the
      monotony of existence when cases were scanty and the papers
      uninteresting.

      One day in early spring he had so far relaxed as to go for a walk
      with me in the Park, where the first faint shoots of green were
      breaking out upon the elms, and the sticky spear-heads of the
      chestnuts were just beginning to burst into their five-fold
      leaves. For two hours we rambled about together, in silence for
      the most part, as befits two men who know each other intimately.
      It was nearly five before we were back in Baker Street once more.

      “Beg pardon, sir,” said our page-boy, as he opened the door.
      “There’s been a gentleman here asking for you, sir.”

      Holmes glanced reproachfully at me. “So much for afternoon
      walks!” said he. “Has this gentleman gone, then?”

      “Yes, sir.”

      “Didn’t you ask him in?”

      “Yes, sir; he came in.”

      “How long did he wait?”

      “Half an hour, sir. He was a very restless gentleman, sir,
      a-walkin’ and a-stampin’ all the time he was here. I was waitin’
      outside the door, sir, and I could hear him. At last he outs into
      the passage, and he cries, ‘Is that man never goin’ to come?’
      Those were his very words, sir. ‘You’ll only need to wait a
      little longer,’ says I. ‘Then I’ll wait in the open air, for I
      feel half choked,’ says he. ‘I’ll be back before long.’ And with
      that he ups and he outs, and all I could say wouldn’t hold him
      back.”

      “Well, well, you did your best,” said Holmes, as we walked into
      our room. “It’s very annoying, though, Watson. I was badly in
      need of a case, and this looks, from the man’s impatience, as if
      it were of importance. Halloa! That’s not your pipe on the table.
      He must have left his behind him. A nice old briar with a good
      long stem of what the tobacconists call amber. I wonder how many
      real amber mouthpieces there are in London. Some people think
      that a fly in it is a sign. Well, he must have been disturbed in
      his mind to leave a pipe behind him which he evidently values
      highly.”

      “How do you know that he values it highly?” I asked.

      “Well, I should put the original cost of the pipe at seven and
      sixpence. Now it has, you see, been twice mended, once in the
      wooden stem and once in the amber. Each of these mends, done, as
      you observe, with silver bands, must have cost more than the pipe
      did originally. The man must value the pipe highly when he
      prefers to patch it up rather than buy a new one with the same
      money.”

      “Anything else?” I asked, for Holmes was turning the pipe about
      in his hand, and staring at it in his peculiar pensive way.

      He held it up and tapped on it with his long, thin fore-finger,
      as a professor might who was lecturing on a bone.

      “Pipes are occasionally of extraordinary interest,” said he.
      “Nothing has more individuality, save perhaps watches and
      bootlaces. The indications here, however, are neither very marked
      nor very important. The owner is obviously a muscular man,
      left-handed, with an excellent set of teeth, careless in his
      habits, and with no need to practise economy.”

      My friend threw out the information in a very offhand way, but I
      saw that he cocked his eye at me to see if I had followed his
      reasoning.

      “You think a man must be well-to-do if he smokes a seven-shilling
      pipe,” said I.

      “This is Grosvenor mixture at eightpence an ounce,” Holmes
      answered, knocking a little out on his palm. “As he might get an
      excellent smoke for half the price, he has no need to practise
      economy.”

      “And the other points?”

      “He has been in the habit of lighting his pipe at lamps and
      gas-jets. You can see that it is quite charred all down one side.
      Of course a match could not have done that. Why should a man hold
      a match to the side of his pipe? But you cannot light it at a
      lamp without getting the bowl charred. And it is all on the right
      side of the pipe. From that I gather that he is a left-handed
      man. You hold your own pipe to the lamp, and see how naturally
      you, being right-handed, hold the left side to the flame. You
      might do it once the other way, but not as a constancy. This has
      always been held so. Then he has bitten through his amber. It
      takes a muscular, energetic fellow, and one with a good set of
      teeth, to do that. But if I am not mistaken I hear him upon the
      stair, so we shall have something more interesting than his pipe
      to study.”

      An instant later our door opened, and a tall young man entered
      the room. He was well but quietly dressed in a dark-grey suit,
      and carried a brown wide-awake in his hand. I should have put him
      at about thirty, though he was really some years older.

      “I beg your pardon,” said he, with some embarrassment; “I suppose
      I should have knocked. Yes, of course I should have knocked. The
      fact is that I am a little upset, and you must put it all down to
      that.” He passed his hand over his forehead like a man who is
      half dazed, and then fell rather than sat down upon a chair.

      “I can see that you have not slept for a night or two,” said
      Holmes, in his easy, genial way. “That tries a man’s nerves more
      than work, and more even than pleasure. May I ask how I can help
      you?”

      “I wanted your advice, sir. I don’t know what to do and my whole
      life seems to have gone to pieces.”

      “You wish to employ me as a consulting detective?”

      “Not that only. I want your opinion as a judicious man—as a man
      of the world. I want to know what I ought to do next. I hope to
      God you’ll be able to tell me.”

      He spoke in little, sharp, jerky outbursts, and it seemed to me
      that to speak at all was very painful to him, and that his will
      all through was overriding his inclinations.

      “It’s a very delicate thing,” said he. “One does not like to
      speak of one’s domestic affairs to strangers. It seems dreadful
      to discuss the conduct of one’s wife with two men whom I have
      never seen before. It’s horrible to have to do it. But I’ve got
      to the end of my tether, and I must have advice.”

      “My dear Mr. Grant Munro—” began Holmes.

      Our visitor sprang from his chair. “What!” he cried, “you know my
      name?”

      “If you wish to preserve your _incognito_,” said Holmes, smiling,
      “I would suggest that you cease to write your name upon the
      lining of your hat, or else that you turn the crown towards the
      person whom you are addressing. I was about to say that my friend
      and I have listened to a good many strange secrets in this room,
      and that we have had the good fortune to bring peace to many
      troubled souls. I trust that we may do as much for you. Might I
      beg you, as time may prove to be of importance, to furnish me
      with the facts of your case without further delay?”

      Our visitor again passed his hand over his forehead, as if he
      found it bitterly hard. From every gesture and expression I could
      see that he was a reserved, self-contained man, with a dash of
      pride in his nature, more likely to hide his wounds than to
      expose them. Then suddenly, with a fierce gesture of his closed
      hand, like one who throws reserve to the winds, he began.

      “The facts are these, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “I am a married man,
      and have been so for three years. During that time my wife and I
      have loved each other as fondly and lived as happily as any two
      that ever were joined. We have not had a difference, not one, in
      thought or word or deed. And now, since last Monday, there has
      suddenly sprung up a barrier between us, and I find that there is
      something in her life and in her thought of which I know as
      little as if she were the woman who brushes by me in the street.
      We are estranged, and I want to know why.

      “Now there is one thing that I want to impress upon you before I
      go any further, Mr. Holmes. Effie loves me. Don’t let there be
      any mistake about that. She loves me with her whole heart and
      soul, and never more than now. I know it. I feel it. I don’t want
      to argue about that. A man can tell easily enough when a woman
      loves him. But there’s this secret between us, and we can never
      be the same until it is cleared.”

      “Kindly let me have the facts, Mr. Munro,” said Holmes, with some
      impatience.

      “I’ll tell you what I know about Effie’s history. She was a widow
      when I met her first, though quite young—only twenty-five. Her
      name then was Mrs. Hebron. She went out to America when she was
      young, and lived in the town of Atlanta, where she married this
      Hebron, who was a lawyer with a good practice. They had one
      child, but the yellow fever broke out badly in the place, and
      both husband and child died of it. I have seen his death
      certificate. This sickened her of America, and she came back to
      live with a maiden aunt at Pinner, in Middlesex. I may mention
      that her husband had left her comfortably off, and that she had a
      capital of about four thousand five hundred pounds, which had
      been so well invested by him that it returned an average of seven
      per cent. She had only been six months at Pinner when I met her;
      we fell in love with each other, and we married a few weeks
      afterwards.

      “I am a hop merchant myself, and as I have an income of seven or
      eight hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a
      nice eighty-pound-a-year villa at Norbury. Our little place was
      very countrified, considering that it is so close to town. We had
      an inn and two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at
      the other side of the field which faces us, and except those
      there were no houses until you got half way to the station. My
      business took me into town at certain seasons, but in summer I
      had less to do, and then in our country home my wife and I were
      just as happy as could be wished. I tell you that there never was
      a shadow between us until this accursed affair began.

      “There’s one thing I ought to tell you before I go further. When
      we married, my wife made over all her property to me—rather
      against my will, for I saw how awkward it would be if my business
      affairs went wrong. However, she would have it so, and it was
      done. Well, about six weeks ago she came to me.

      “‘Jack,’ said she, ‘when you took my money you said that if ever
      I wanted any I was to ask you for it.’

      “‘Certainly,’ said I. ‘It’s all your own.’

      “‘Well,’ said she, ‘I want a hundred pounds.’

      “I was a bit staggered at this, for I had imagined it was simply
      a new dress or something of the kind that she was after.

      “‘What on earth for?’ I asked.

      “‘Oh,’ said she, in her playful way, ‘you said that you were only
      my banker, and bankers never ask questions, you know.’

      “‘If you really mean it, of course you shall have the money,’
      said I.

      “‘Oh, yes, I really mean it.’

      “‘And you won’t tell me what you want it for?’

      “‘Some day, perhaps, but not just at present, Jack.’

      “So I had to be content with that, though it was the first time
      that there had ever been any secret between us. I gave her a
      check, and I never thought any more of the matter. It may have
      nothing to do with what came afterwards, but I thought it only
      right to mention it.

      “Well, I told you just now that there is a cottage not far from
      our house. There is just a field between us, but to reach it you
      have to go along the road and then turn down a lane. Just beyond
      it is a nice little grove of Scotch firs, and I used to be very
      fond of strolling down there, for trees are always a neighbourly
      kind of things. The cottage had been standing empty this eight
      months, and it was a pity, for it was a pretty two-storied place,
      with an old-fashioned porch and honeysuckle about it. I have
      stood many a time and thought what a neat little homestead it
      would make.

      “Well, last Monday evening I was taking a stroll down that way,
      when I met an empty van coming up the lane, and saw a pile of
      carpets and things lying about on the grass-plot beside the
      porch. It was clear that the cottage had at last been let. I
      walked past it, and wondered what sort of folk they were who had
      come to live so near us. And as I looked I suddenly became aware
      that a face was watching me out of one of the upper windows.

      “I don’t know what there was about that face, Mr. Holmes, but it
      seemed to send a chill right down my back. I was some little way
      off, so that I could not make out the features, but there was
      something unnatural and inhuman about the face. That was the
      impression that I had, and I moved quickly forwards to get a
      nearer view of the person who was watching me. But as I did so
      the face suddenly disappeared, so suddenly that it seemed to have
      been plucked away into the darkness of the room. I stood for five
      minutes thinking the business over, and trying to analyze my
      impressions. I could not tell if the face were that of a man or a
      woman. It had been too far from me for that. But its colour was
      what had impressed me most. It was of a livid chalky white, and
      with something set and rigid about it which was shockingly
      unnatural. So disturbed was I that I determined to see a little
      more of the new inmates of the cottage. I approached and knocked
      at the door, which was instantly opened by a tall, gaunt woman
      with a harsh, forbidding face.

      “‘What may you be wantin’?’ she asked, in a Northern accent.

      “‘I am your neighbour over yonder,’ said I, nodding towards my
      house. ‘I see that you have only just moved in, so I thought that
      if I could be of any help to you in any—’

      “‘Ay, we’ll just ask ye when we want ye,’ said she, and shut the
      door in my face. Annoyed at the churlish rebuff, I turned my back
      and walked home. All evening, though I tried to think of other
      things, my mind would still turn to the apparition at the window
      and the rudeness of the woman. I determined to say nothing about
      the former to my wife, for she is a nervous, highly strung woman,
      and I had no wish that she would share the unpleasant impression
      which had been produced upon myself. I remarked to her, however,
      before I fell asleep, that the cottage was now occupied, to which
      she returned no reply.

      “I am usually an extremely sound sleeper. It has been a standing
      jest in the family that nothing could ever wake me during the
      night. And yet somehow on that particular night, whether it may
      have been the slight excitement produced by my little adventure
      or not I know not, but I slept much more lightly than usual. Half
      in my dreams I was dimly conscious that something was going on in
      the room, and gradually became aware that my wife had dressed
      herself and was slipping on her mantle and her bonnet. My lips
      were parted to murmur out some sleepy words of surprise or
      remonstrance at this untimely preparation, when suddenly my
      half-opened eyes fell upon her face, illuminated by the
      candle-light, and astonishment held me dumb. She wore an
      expression such as I had never seen before—such as I should have
      thought her incapable of assuming. She was deadly pale and
      breathing fast, glancing furtively towards the bed as she
      fastened her mantle, to see if she had disturbed me. Then,
      thinking that I was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly from
      the room, and an instant later I heard a sharp creaking which
      could only come from the hinges of the front door. I sat up in
      bed and rapped my knuckles against the rail to make certain that
      I was truly awake. Then I took my watch from under the pillow. It
      was three in the morning. What on this earth could my wife be
      doing out on the country road at three in the morning?

      “I had sat for about twenty minutes turning the thing over in my
      mind and trying to find some possible explanation. The more I
      thought, the more extraordinary and inexplicable did it appear. I
      was still puzzling over it when I heard the door gently close
      again, and her footsteps coming up the stairs.

      “‘Where in the world have you been, Effie?’ I asked as she
      entered.

      “She gave a violent start and a kind of gasping cry when I spoke,
      and that cry and start troubled me more than all the rest, for
      there was something indescribably guilty about them. My wife had
      always been a woman of a frank, open nature, and it gave me a
      chill to see her slinking into her own room, and crying out and
      wincing when her own husband spoke to her.

      “‘You awake, Jack!’ she cried, with a nervous laugh. ‘Why, I
      thought that nothing could awake you.’

      “‘Where have you been?’ I asked, more sternly.

      “‘I don’t wonder that you are surprised,’ said she, and I could
      see that her fingers were trembling as she undid the fastenings
      of her mantle. ‘Why, I never remember having done such a thing in
      my life before. The fact is that I felt as though I were choking,
      and had a perfect longing for a breath of fresh air. I really
      think that I should have fainted if I had not gone out. I stood
      at the door for a few minutes, and now I am quite myself again.’

      “All the time that she was telling me this story she never once
      looked in my direction, and her voice was quite unlike her usual
      tones. It was evident to me that she was saying what was false. I
      said nothing in reply, but turned my face to the wall, sick at
      heart, with my mind filled with a thousand venomous doubts and
      suspicions. What was it that my wife was concealing from me?
      Where had she been during that strange expedition? I felt that I
      should have no peace until I knew, and yet I shrank from asking
      her again after once she had told me what was false. All the rest
      of the night I tossed and tumbled, framing theory after theory,
      each more unlikely than the last.

      “I should have gone to the City that day, but I was too disturbed
      in my mind to be able to pay attention to business matters. My
      wife seemed to be as upset as myself, and I could see from the
      little questioning glances which she kept shooting at me that she
      understood that I disbelieved her statement, and that she was at
      her wits’ end what to do. We hardly exchanged a word during
      breakfast, and immediately afterwards I went out for a walk, that
      I might think the matter out in the fresh morning air.

      “I went as far as the Crystal Palace, spent an hour in the
      grounds, and was back in Norbury by one o’clock. It happened that
      my way took me past the cottage, and I stopped for an instant to
      look at the windows, and to see if I could catch a glimpse of the
      strange face which had looked out at me on the day before. As I
      stood there, imagine my surprise, Mr. Holmes, when the door
      suddenly opened and my wife walked out.

      “I was struck dumb with astonishment at the sight of her; but my
      emotions were nothing to those which showed themselves upon her
      face when our eyes met. She seemed for an instant to wish to
      shrink back inside the house again; and then, seeing how useless
      all concealment must be, she came forward, with a very white face
      and frightened eyes which belied the smile upon her lips.

      “‘Ah, Jack,’ she said, ‘I have just been in to see if I can be of
      any assistance to our new neighbours. Why do you look at me like
      that, Jack? You are not angry with me?’

      “‘So,’ said I, ‘this is where you went during the night.’

      “‘What do you mean?’ she cried.

      “‘You came here. I am sure of it. Who are these people, that you
      should visit them at such an hour?’

      “‘I have not been here before.’

      “‘How can you tell me what you know is false?’ I cried. ‘Your
      very voice changes as you speak. When have I ever had a secret
      from you? I shall enter that cottage, and I shall probe the
      matter to the bottom.’

      “‘No, no, Jack, for God’s sake!’ she gasped, in uncontrollable
      emotion. Then, as I approached the door, she seized my sleeve and
      pulled me back with convulsive strength.

      “‘I implore you not to do this, Jack,’ she cried. ‘I swear that I
      will tell you everything some day, but nothing but misery can
      come of it if you enter that cottage.’ Then, as I tried to shake
      her off, she clung to me in a frenzy of entreaty.

      “‘Trust me, Jack!’ she cried. ‘Trust me only this once. You will
      never have cause to regret it. You know that I would not have a
      secret from you if it were not for your own sake. Our whole lives
      are at stake in this. If you come home with me, all will be well.
      If you force your way into that cottage, all is over between us.’

      “There was such earnestness, such despair, in her manner that her
      words arrested me, and I stood irresolute before the door.

      “‘I will trust you on one condition, and on one condition only,’
      said I at last. ‘It is that this mystery comes to an end from
      now. You are at liberty to preserve your secret, but you must
      promise me that there shall be no more nightly visits, no more
      doings which are kept from my knowledge. I am willing to forget
      those which are passed if you will promise that there shall be no
      more in the future.’

      “‘I was sure that you would trust me,’ she cried, with a great
      sigh of relief. ‘It shall be just as you wish. Come away—oh, come
      away up to the house.’

      “Still pulling at my sleeve, she led me away from the cottage. As
      we went I glanced back, and there was that yellow livid face
      watching us out of the upper window. What link could there be
      between that creature and my wife? Or how could the coarse, rough
      woman whom I had seen the day before be connected with her? It
      was a strange puzzle, and yet I knew that my mind could never
      know ease again until I had solved it.

      “For two days after this I stayed at home, and my wife appeared
      to abide loyally by our engagement, for, as far as I know, she
      never stirred out of the house. On the third day, however, I had
      ample evidence that her solemn promise was not enough to hold her
      back from this secret influence which drew her away from her
      husband and her duty.

      “I had gone into town on that day, but I returned by the 2.40
      instead of the 3.36, which is my usual train. As I entered the
      house the maid ran into the hall with a startled face.

      “‘Where is your mistress?’ I asked.

      “‘I think that she has gone out for a walk,’ she answered.

      “My mind was instantly filled with suspicion. I rushed upstairs
      to make sure that she was not in the house. As I did so I
      happened to glance out of one of the upper windows, and saw the
      maid with whom I had just been speaking running across the field
      in the direction of the cottage. Then of course I saw exactly
      what it all meant. My wife had gone over there, and had asked the
      servant to call her if I should return. Tingling with anger, I
      rushed down and hurried across, determined to end the matter once
      and forever. I saw my wife and the maid hurrying back along the
      lane, but I did not stop to speak with them. In the cottage lay
      the secret which was casting a shadow over my life. I vowed that,
      come what might, it should be a secret no longer. I did not even
      knock when I reached it, but turned the handle and rushed into
      the passage.

      “It was all still and quiet upon the ground floor. In the kitchen
      a kettle was singing on the fire, and a large black cat lay
      coiled up in the basket; but there was no sign of the woman whom
      I had seen before. I ran into the other room, but it was equally
      deserted. Then I rushed up the stairs, only to find two other
      rooms empty and deserted at the top. There was no one at all in
      the whole house. The furniture and pictures were of the most
      common and vulgar description, save in the one chamber at the
      window of which I had seen the strange face. That was comfortable
      and elegant, and all my suspicions rose into a fierce bitter
      flame when I saw that on the mantelpiece stood a copy of a
      full-length photograph of my wife, which had been taken at my
      request only three months ago.

      “I stayed long enough to make certain that the house was
      absolutely empty. Then I left it, feeling a weight at my heart
      such as I had never had before. My wife came out into the hall as
      I entered my house; but I was too hurt and angry to speak with
      her, and pushing past her, I made my way into my study. She
      followed me, however, before I could close the door.

      “‘I am sorry that I broke my promise, Jack,’ said she; ‘but if
      you knew all the circumstances I am sure that you would forgive
      me.’

      “‘Tell me everything, then,’ said I.

      “‘I cannot, Jack, I cannot,’ she cried.

      “‘Until you tell me who it is that has been living in that
      cottage, and who it is to whom you have given that photograph,
      there can never be any confidence between us,’ said I, and
      breaking away from her, I left the house. That was yesterday, Mr.
      Holmes, and I have not seen her since, nor do I know anything
      more about this strange business. It is the first shadow that has
      come between us, and it has so shaken me that I do not know what
      I should do for the best. Suddenly this morning it occurred to me
      that you were the man to advise me, so I have hurried to you now,
      and I place myself unreservedly in your hands. If there is any
      point which I have not made clear, pray question me about it.
      But, above all, tell me quickly what I am to do, for this misery
      is more than I can bear.”

      Holmes and I had listened with the utmost interest to this
      extraordinary statement, which had been delivered in the jerky,
      broken fashion of a man who is under the influence of extreme
      emotions. My companion sat silent for some time, with his chin
      upon his hand, lost in thought.

      “Tell me,” said he at last, “could you swear that this was a
      man’s face which you saw at the window?”

      “Each time that I saw it I was some distance away from it, so
      that it is impossible for me to say.”

      “You appear, however, to have been disagreeably impressed by it.”

      “It seemed to be of an unnatural colour, and to have a strange
      rigidity about the features. When I approached, it vanished with
      a jerk.”

      “How long is it since your wife asked you for a hundred pounds?”

      “Nearly two months.”

      “Have you ever seen a photograph of her first husband?”

      “No; there was a great fire at Atlanta very shortly after his
      death, and all her papers were destroyed.”

      “And yet she had a certificate of death. You say that you saw
      it.”

      “Yes; she got a duplicate after the fire.”

      “Did you ever meet any one who knew her in America?”

      “No.”

      “Did she ever talk of revisiting the place?”

      “No.”

      “Or get letters from it?”

      “No.”

      “Thank you. I should like to think over the matter a little now.
      If the cottage is now permanently deserted we may have some
      difficulty. If, on the other hand, as I fancy is more likely, the
      inmates were warned of your coming, and left before you entered
      yesterday, then they may be back now, and we should clear it all
      up easily. Let me advise you, then, to return to Norbury, and to
      examine the windows of the cottage again. If you have reason to
      believe that it is inhabited, do not force your way in, but send
      a wire to my friend and me. We shall be with you within an hour
      of receiving it, and we shall then very soon get to the bottom of
      the business.”

      “And if it is still empty?”

      “In that case I shall come out to-morrow and talk it over with
      you. Good-by; and, above all, do not fret until you know that you
      really have a cause for it.”

      “I am afraid that this is a bad business, Watson,” said my
      companion, as he returned after accompanying Mr. Grant Munro to
      the door. “What do you make of it?”

      “It had an ugly sound,” I answered.

      “Yes. There’s blackmail in it, or I am much mistaken.”

      “And who is the blackmailer?”

      “Well, it must be the creature who lives in the only comfortable
      room in the place, and has her photograph above his fireplace.
      Upon my word, Watson, there is something very attractive about
      that livid face at the window, and I would not have missed the
      case for worlds.”

      “You have a theory?”

      “Yes, a provisional one. But I shall be surprised if it does not
      turn out to be correct. This woman’s first husband is in that
      cottage.”

      “Why do you think so?”

      “How else can we explain her frenzied anxiety that her second one
      should not enter it? The facts, as I read them, are something
      like this: This woman was married in America. Her husband
      developed some hateful qualities; or shall we say that he
      contracted some loathsome disease, and became a leper or an
      imbecile? She flies from him at last, returns to England, changes
      her name, and starts her life, as she thinks, afresh. She has
      been married three years, and believes that her position is quite
      secure, having shown her husband the death certificate of some
      man whose name she has assumed, when suddenly her whereabouts is
      discovered by her first husband; or, we may suppose, by some
      unscrupulous woman who has attached herself to the invalid. They
      write to the wife, and threaten to come and expose her. She asks
      for a hundred pounds, and endeavours to buy them off. They come
      in spite of it, and when the husband mentions casually to the
      wife that there are new-comers in the cottage, she knows in some
      way that they are her pursuers. She waits until her husband is
      asleep, and then she rushes down to endeavour to persuade them to
      leave her in peace. Having no success, she goes again next
      morning, and her husband meets her, as he has told us, as she
      comes out. She promises him then not to go there again, but two
      days afterwards the hope of getting rid of those dreadful
      neighbours was too strong for her, and she made another attempt,
      taking down with her the photograph which had probably been
      demanded from her. In the midst of this interview the maid rushed
      in to say that the master had come home, on which the wife,
      knowing that he would come straight down to the cottage, hurried
      the inmates out at the back door, into the grove of fir-trees,
      probably, which was mentioned as standing near. In this way he
      found the place deserted. I shall be very much surprised,
      however, if it is still so when he reconnoitres it this evening.
      What do you think of my theory?”

      “It is all surmise.”

      “But at least it covers all the facts. When new facts come to our
      knowledge which cannot be covered by it, it will be time enough
      to reconsider it. We can do nothing more until we have a message
      from our friend at Norbury.”

      But we had not a very long time to wait for that. It came just as
      we had finished our tea. “The cottage is still tenanted,” it
      said. “Have seen the face again at the window. Will meet the
      seven o’clock train, and will take no steps until you arrive.”

      He was waiting on the platform when we stepped out, and we could
      see in the light of the station lamps that he was very pale, and
      quivering with agitation.

      “They are still there, Mr. Holmes,” said he, laying his hand hard
      upon my friend’s sleeve. “I saw lights in the cottage as I came
      down. We shall settle it now once and for all.”

      “What is your plan, then?” asked Holmes, as he walked down the
      dark tree-lined road.

      “I am going to force my way in and see for myself who is in the
      house. I wish you both to be there as witnesses.”

      “You are quite determined to do this, in spite of your wife’s
      warning that it is better that you should not solve the mystery?”

      “Yes, I am determined.”

      “Well, I think that you are in the right. Any truth is better
      than indefinite doubt. We had better go up at once. Of course,
      legally, we are putting ourselves hopelessly in the wrong; but I
      think that it is worth it.”

      It was a very dark night, and a thin rain began to fall as we
      turned from the high road into a narrow lane, deeply rutted, with
      hedges on either side. Mr. Grant Munro pushed impatiently
      forward, however, and we stumbled after him as best we could.

      “There are the lights of my house,” he murmured, pointing to a
      glimmer among the trees. “And here is the cottage which I am
      going to enter.”

      We turned a corner in the lane as he spoke, and there was the
      building close beside us. A yellow bar falling across the black
      foreground showed that the door was not quite closed, and one
      window in the upper story was brightly illuminated. As we looked,
      we saw a dark blur moving across the blind.

      “There is that creature!” cried Grant Munro. “You can see for
      yourselves that some one is there. Now follow me, and we shall
      soon know all.”

      We approached the door; but suddenly a woman appeared out of the
      shadow and stood in the golden track of the lamp-light. I could
      not see her face in the darkness, but her arms were thrown out in
      an attitude of entreaty.

      “For God’s sake, don’t Jack!” she cried. “I had a presentiment
      that you would come this evening. Think better of it, dear! Trust
      me again, and you will never have cause to regret it.”

      “I have trusted you too long, Effie,” he cried, sternly. “Leave
      go of me! I must pass you. My friends and I are going to settle
      this matter once and forever!” He pushed her to one side, and we
      followed closely after him. As he threw the door open an old
      woman ran out in front of him and tried to bar his passage, but
      he thrust her back, and an instant afterwards we were all upon
      the stairs. Grant Munro rushed into the lighted room at the top,
      and we entered at his heels.

      It was a cosey, well-furnished apartment, with two candles
      burning upon the table and two upon the mantelpiece. In the
      corner, stooping over a desk, there sat what appeared to be a
      little girl. Her face was turned away as we entered, but we could
      see that she was dressed in a red frock, and that she had long
      white gloves on. As she whisked round to us, I gave a cry of
      surprise and horror. The face which she turned towards us was of
      the strangest livid tint, and the features were absolutely devoid
      of any expression. An instant later the mystery was explained.
      Holmes, with a laugh, passed his hand behind the child’s ear, a
      mask peeled off from her countenance, and there was a little coal
      black negress, with all her white teeth flashing in amusement at
      our amazed faces. I burst out laughing, out of sympathy with her
      merriment; but Grant Munro stood staring, with his hand clutching
      his throat.

      “My God!” he cried. “What can be the meaning of this?”

      “I will tell you the meaning of it,” cried the lady, sweeping
      into the room with a proud, set face. “You have forced me,
      against my own judgment, to tell you, and now we must both make
      the best of it. My husband died at Atlanta. My child survived.”

      “Your child?”

      She drew a large silver locket from her bosom. “You have never
      seen this open.”

      “I understood that it did not open.”

      She touched a spring, and the front hinged back. There was a
      portrait within of a man strikingly handsome and
      intelligent-looking, but bearing unmistakable signs upon his
      features of his African descent.

      “That is John Hebron, of Atlanta,” said the lady, “and a nobler
      man never walked the earth. I cut myself off from my race in
      order to wed him, but never once while he lived did I for an
      instant regret it. It was our misfortune that our only child took
      after his people rather than mine. It is often so in such
      matches, and little Lucy is darker far than ever her father was.
      But dark or fair, she is my own dear little girlie, and her
      mother’s pet.” The little creature ran across at the words and
      nestled up against the lady’s dress. “When I left her in
      America,” she continued, “it was only because her health was
      weak, and the change might have done her harm. She was given to
      the care of a faithful Scotch woman who had once been our
      servant. Never for an instant did I dream of disowning her as my
      child. But when chance threw you in my way, Jack, and I learned
      to love you, I feared to tell you about my child. God forgive me,
      I feared that I should lose you, and I had not the courage to
      tell you. I had to choose between you, and in my weakness I
      turned away from my own little girl. For three years I have kept
      her existence a secret from you, but I heard from the nurse, and
      I knew that all was well with her. At last, however, there came
      an overwhelming desire to see the child once more. I struggled
      against it, but in vain. Though I knew the danger, I determined
      to have the child over, if it were but for a few weeks. I sent a
      hundred pounds to the nurse, and I gave her instructions about
      this cottage, so that she might come as a neighbour, without my
      appearing to be in any way connected with her. I pushed my
      precautions so far as to order her to keep the child in the house
      during the daytime, and to cover up her little face and hands so
      that even those who might see her at the window should not gossip
      about there being a black child in the neighbourhood. If I had
      been less cautious I might have been more wise, but I was half
      crazy with fear that you should learn the truth.

      “It was you who told me first that the cottage was occupied. I
      should have waited for the morning, but I could not sleep for
      excitement, and so at last I slipped out, knowing how difficult
      it is to awake you. But you saw me go, and that was the beginning
      of my troubles. Next day you had my secret at your mercy, but you
      nobly refrained from pursuing your advantage. Three days later,
      however, the nurse and child only just escaped from the back door
      as you rushed in at the front one. And now to-night you at last
      know all, and I ask you what is to become of us, my child and
      me?” She clasped her hands and waited for an answer.

      It was a long ten minutes before Grant Munro broke the silence,
      and when his answer came it was one of which I love to think. He
      lifted the little child, kissed her, and then, still carrying
      her, he held his other hand out to his wife and turned towards
      the door.

      “We can talk it over more comfortably at home,” said he. “I am
      not a very good man, Effie, but I think that I am a better one
      than you have given me credit for being.”

      Holmes and I followed them down the lane, and my friend plucked
      at my sleeve as we came out.

      “I think,” said he, “that we shall be of more use in London than
      in Norbury.”

      Not another word did he say of the case until late that night,
      when he was turning away, with his lighted candle, for his
      bedroom.

      “Watson,” said he, “if it should ever strike you that I am
      getting a little over-confident in my powers, or giving less
      pains to a case than it deserves, kindly whisper ‘Norbury’ in my
      ear, and I shall be infinitely obliged to you.”




IV. The Stockbroker’s Clerk


      Shortly after my marriage I had bought a connection in the
      Paddington district. Old Mr. Farquhar, from whom I purchased it,
      had at one time an excellent general practice; but his age, and
      an affliction of the nature of St. Vitus’s dance from which he
      suffered, had very much thinned it. The public not unnaturally
      goes on the principle that he who would heal others must himself
      be whole, and looks askance at the curative powers of the man
      whose own case is beyond the reach of his drugs. Thus as my
      predecessor weakened his practice declined, until when I
      purchased it from him it had sunk from twelve hundred to little
      more than three hundred a year. I had confidence, however, in my
      own youth and energy, and was convinced that in a very few years
      the concern would be as flourishing as ever.

      For three months after taking over the practice I was kept very
      closely at work, and saw little of my friend Sherlock Holmes, for
      I was too busy to visit Baker Street, and he seldom went anywhere
      himself save upon professional business. I was surprised,
      therefore, when, one morning in June, as I sat reading the
      _British Medical Journal_ after breakfast, I heard a ring at the
      bell, followed by the high, somewhat strident tones of my old
      companion’s voice.

      “Ah, my dear Watson,” said he, striding into the room, “I am very
      delighted to see you! I trust that Mrs. Watson has entirely
      recovered from all the little excitements connected with our
      adventure of the Sign of Four.”

      “Thank you, we are both very well,” said I, shaking him warmly by
      the hand.

      “And I hope, also,” he continued, sitting down in the
      rocking-chair, “that the cares of medical practice have not
      entirely obliterated the interest which you used to take in our
      little deductive problems.”

      “On the contrary,” I answered, “it was only last night that I was
      looking over my old notes, and classifying some of our past
      results.”

      “I trust that you don’t consider your collection closed.”

      “Not at all. I should wish nothing better than to have some more
      of such experiences.”

      “To-day, for example?”

      “Yes, to-day, if you like.”

      “And as far off as Birmingham?”

      “Certainly, if you wish it.”

      “And the practice?”

      “I do my neighbour’s when he goes. He is always ready to work off
      the debt.”

      “Ha! Nothing could be better,” said Holmes, leaning back in his
      chair and looking keenly at me from under his half closed lids.
      “I perceive that you have been unwell lately. Summer colds are
      always a little trying.”

      “I was confined to the house by a severe chill for three days
      last week. I thought, however, that I had cast off every trace of
      it.”

      “So you have. You look remarkably robust.”

      “How, then, did you know of it?”

      “My dear fellow, you know my methods.”

      “You deduced it, then?”

      “Certainly.”

      “And from what?”

      “From your slippers.”

      I glanced down at the new patent leathers which I was wearing.
      “How on earth—” I began, but Holmes answered my question before
      it was asked.

      “Your slippers are new,” he said. “You could not have had them
      more than a few weeks. The soles which you are at this moment
      presenting to me are slightly scorched. For a moment I thought
      they might have got wet and been burned in the drying. But near
      the instep there is a small circular wafer of paper with the
      shopman’s hieroglyphics upon it. Damp would of course have
      removed this. You had, then, been sitting with your feet
      outstretched to the fire, which a man would hardly do even in so
      wet a June as this if he were in his full health.”

      Like all Holmes’s reasoning the thing seemed simplicity itself
      when it was once explained. He read the thought upon my features,
      and his smile had a tinge of bitterness.

      “I am afraid that I rather give myself away when I explain,” said
      he. “Results without causes are much more impressive. You are
      ready to come to Birmingham, then?”

      “Certainly. What is the case?”

      “You shall hear it all in the train. My client is outside in a
      four-wheeler. Can you come at once?”

      “In an instant.” I scribbled a note to my neighbour, rushed
      upstairs to explain the matter to my wife, and joined Holmes upon
      the door-step.

      “Your neighbour is a doctor,” said he, nodding at the brass
      plate.

      “Yes; he bought a practice as I did.”

      “An old-established one?”

      “Just the same as mine. Both have been ever since the houses were
      built.”

      “Ah! Then you got hold of the best of the two.”

      “I think I did. But how do you know?”

      “By the steps, my boy. Yours are worn three inches deeper than
      his. But this gentleman in the cab is my client, Mr. Hall
      Pycroft. Allow me to introduce you to him. Whip your horse up,
      cabby, for we have only just time to catch our train.”

      The man whom I found myself facing was a well-built,
      fresh-complexioned young fellow, with a frank, honest face and a
      slight, crisp, yellow moustache. He wore a very shiny top hat and
      a neat suit of sober black, which made him look what he was—a
      smart young City man, of the class who have been labeled
      cockneys, but who give us our crack volunteer regiments, and who
      turn out more fine athletes and sportsmen than any body of men in
      these islands. His round, ruddy face was naturally full of
      cheeriness, but the corners of his mouth seemed to me to be
      pulled down in a half-comical distress. It was not, however,
      until we were all in a first-class carriage and well started upon
      our journey to Birmingham that I was able to learn what the
      trouble was which had driven him to Sherlock Holmes.

      “We have a clear run here of seventy minutes,” Holmes remarked.
      “I want you, Mr. Hall Pycroft, to tell my friend your very
      interesting experience exactly as you have told it to me, or with
      more detail if possible. It will be of use to me to hear the
      succession of events again. It is a case, Watson, which may prove
      to have something in it, or may prove to have nothing, but which,
      at least, presents those unusual and _outré_ features which are
      as dear to you as they are to me. Now, Mr. Pycroft, I shall not
      interrupt you again.”

      Our young companion looked at me with a twinkle in his eye.

      “The worst of the story is,” said he, “that I show myself up as
      such a confounded fool. Of course it may work out all right, and
      I don’t see that I could have done otherwise; but if I have lost
      my crib and get nothing in exchange I shall feel what a soft
      Johnnie I have been. I’m not very good at telling a story, Dr.
      Watson, but it is like this with me:

      “I used to have a billet at Coxon & Woodhouse, of Drapers’
      Gardens, but they were let in early in the spring through the
      Venezuelan loan, as no doubt you remember, and came a nasty
      cropper. I had been with them five years, and old Coxon gave me a
      ripping good testimonial when the smash came, but of course we
      clerks were all turned adrift, the twenty-seven of us. I tried
      here and tried there, but there were lots of other chaps on the
      same lay as myself, and it was a perfect frost for a long time. I
      had been taking three pounds a week at Coxon’s, and I had saved
      about seventy of them, but I soon worked my way through that and
      out at the other end. I was fairly at the end of my tether at
      last, and could hardly find the stamps to answer the
      advertisements or the envelopes to stick them to. I had worn out
      my boots paddling up office stairs, and I seemed just as far from
      getting a billet as ever.

      “At last I saw a vacancy at Mawson & Williams’, the great
      stockbroking firm in Lombard Street. I daresay E.C. is not much
      in your line, but I can tell you that this is about the richest
      house in London. The advertisement was to be answered by letter
      only. I sent in my testimonial and application, but without the
      least hope of getting it. Back came an answer by return, saying
      that if I would appear next Monday I might take over my new
      duties at once, provided that my appearance was satisfactory. No
      one knows how these things are worked. Some people say that the
      manager just plunges his hand into the heap and takes the first
      that comes. Anyhow it was my innings that time, and I don’t ever
      wish to feel better pleased. The screw was a pound a week rise,
      and the duties just about the same as at Coxon’s.

      “And now I come to the queer part of the business. I was in
      diggings out Hampstead way—17, Potter’s Terrace. Well, I was
      sitting doing a smoke that very evening after I had been promised
      the appointment, when up came my landlady with a card which had
      ‘Arthur Pinner, Financial Agent,’ printed upon it. I had never
      heard the name before and could not imagine what he wanted with
      me; but, of course, I asked her to show him up. In he walked, a
      middle-sized, dark-haired, dark-eyed, black-bearded man, with a
      touch of the Sheeny about his nose. He had a brisk kind of way
      with him and spoke sharply, like a man who knew the value of
      time.”

      “‘Mr. Hall Pycroft, I believe?’” said he.

      “‘Yes, sir,’ I answered, pushing a chair towards him.

      “‘Lately engaged at Coxon & Woodhouse’s?’

      “‘Yes, sir.’

      “‘And now on the staff of Mawson’s.’

      “‘Quite so.’

      “‘Well,’ said he, ‘the fact is that I have heard some really
      extraordinary stories about your financial ability. You remember
      Parker, who used to be Coxon’s manager? He can never say enough
      about it.’

      “Of course I was pleased to hear this. I had always been pretty
      sharp in the office, but I had never dreamed that I was talked
      about in the City in this fashion.

      “‘You have a good memory?’ said he.

      “‘Pretty fair,’ I answered, modestly.

      “‘Have you kept in touch with the market while you have been out
      of work?’ he asked.

      “‘Yes; I read the Stock Exchange List every morning.’

      “‘Now that shows real application!’ he cried. ‘That is the way to
      prosper! You won’t mind my testing you, will you? Let me see. How
      are Ayrshires?’

      “‘A hundred and six and a quarter to a hundred and five and
      seven-eighths.’

      “‘And New Zealand Consolidated?’

      “‘A hundred and four.

      “‘And British Broken Hills?’

      “‘Seven to seven-and-six.’

      “‘Wonderful!’ he cried, with his hands up. ‘This quite fits in
      with all that I had heard. My boy, my boy, you are very much too
      good to be a clerk at Mawson’s!’

      “This outburst rather astonished me, as you can think. ‘Well,’
      said I, ‘other people don’t think quite so much of me as you seem
      to do, Mr. Pinner. I had a hard enough fight to get this berth,
      and I am very glad to have it.’

      “‘Pooh, man; you should soar above it. You are not in your true
      sphere. Now, I’ll tell you how it stands with me. What I have to
      offer is little enough when measured by your ability, but when
      compared with Mawson’s, it’s light to dark. Let me see. When do
      you go to Mawson’s?’

      “‘On Monday.’

      “‘Ha, ha! I think I would risk a little sporting flutter that you
      don’t go there at all.’

      “‘Not go to Mawson’s?’

      “‘No, sir. By that day you will be the business manager of the
      Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited, with a hundred and
      thirty-four branches in the towns and villages of France, not
      counting one in Brussels and one in San Remo.’

      “This took my breath away. ‘I never heard of it,’ said I.

      “‘Very likely not. It has been kept very quiet, for the capital
      was all privately subscribed, and it’s too good a thing to let
      the public into. My brother, Harry Pinner, is promoter, and joins
      the board after allotment as managing director. He knew I was in
      the swim down here, and asked me to pick up a good man cheap. A
      young, pushing man with plenty of snap about him. Parker spoke of
      you, and that brought me here to-night. We can only offer you a
      beggarly five hundred to start with.’

      “‘Five hundred a year!’ I shouted.

      “‘Only that at the beginning; but you are to have an overriding
      commission of one per cent on all business done by your agents,
      and you may take my word for it that this will come to more than
      your salary.’

      “‘But I know nothing about hardware.’

      “‘Tut, my boy; you know about figures.’

      “My head buzzed, and I could hardly sit still in my chair. But
      suddenly a little chill of doubt came upon me.

      “‘I must be frank with you,’ said I. ‘Mawson only gives me two
      hundred, but Mawson is safe. Now, really, I know so little about
      your company that—’

      “‘Ah, smart, smart!’ he cried, in a kind of ecstasy of delight.
      ‘You are the very man for us. You are not to be talked over, and
      quite right, too. Now, here’s a note for a hundred pounds, and if
      you think that we can do business you may just slip it into your
      pocket as an advance upon your salary.’

      “‘That is very handsome,’ said I. ‘When should I take over my new
      duties?’

      “‘Be in Birmingham to-morrow at one,’ said he. ‘I have a note in
      my pocket here which you will take to my brother. You will find
      him at 126B, Corporation Street, where the temporary offices of
      the company are situated. Of course he must confirm your
      engagement, but between ourselves it will be all right.’

      “‘Really, I hardly know how to express my gratitude, Mr. Pinner,’
      said I.

      “‘Not at all, my boy. You have only got your deserts. There are
      one or two small things—mere formalities—which I must arrange
      with you. You have a bit of paper beside you there. Kindly write
      upon it “I am perfectly willing to act as business manager to the
      Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited, at a minimum salary of
      £500.”’

      “I did as he asked, and he put the paper in his pocket.

      “‘There is one other detail,’ said he. ‘What do you intend to do
      about Mawson’s?’

      “I had forgotten all about Mawson’s in my joy. ‘I’ll write and
      resign,’ said I.

      “‘Precisely what I don’t want you to do. I had a row over you
      with Mawson’s manager. I had gone up to ask him about you, and he
      was very offensive; accused me of coaxing you away from the
      service of the firm, and that sort of thing. At last I fairly
      lost my temper. “If you want good men you should pay them a good
      price,” said I.’

      “‘He would rather have our small price than your big one,’ said
      he.

      “‘I’ll lay you a fiver,’ said I, ‘that when he has my offer
      you’ll never so much as hear from him again.’

      “‘Done!’ said he. ‘We picked him out of the gutter, and he won’t
      leave us so easily.’ Those were his very words.”

      “‘The impudent scoundrel!’ I cried. ‘I’ve never so much as seen
      him in my life. Why should I consider him in any way? I shall
      certainly not write if you would rather I didn’t.’

      “‘Good! That’s a promise,’ said he, rising from his chair. ‘Well,
      I’m delighted to have got so good a man for my brother. Here’s
      your advance of a hundred pounds, and here is the letter. Make a
      note of the address, 126B, Corporation Street, and remember that
      one o’clock to-morrow is your appointment. Good-night; and may
      you have all the fortune that you deserve!’

      “That’s just about all that passed between us, as near as I can
      remember. You can imagine, Dr. Watson, how pleased I was at such
      an extraordinary bit of good fortune. I sat up half the night
      hugging myself over it, and next day I was off to Birmingham in a
      train that would take me in plenty time for my appointment. I
      took my things to a hotel in New Street, and then I made my way
      to the address which had been given me.

      “It was a quarter of an hour before my time, but I thought that
      would make no difference. 126B, was a passage between two large
      shops, which led to a winding stone stair, from which there were
      many flats, let as offices to companies or professional men. The
      names of the occupants were painted at the bottom on the wall,
      but there was no such name as the Franco-Midland Hardware
      Company, Limited. I stood for a few minutes with my heart in my
      boots, wondering whether the whole thing was an elaborate hoax or
      not, when up came a man and addressed me. He was very like the
      chap I had seen the night before, the same figure and voice, but
      he was clean shaven and his hair was lighter.

      “‘Are you Mr. Hall Pycroft?’ he asked.

      “‘Yes,’ said I.

      “‘Oh! I was expecting you, but you are a trifle before your time.
      I had a note from my brother this morning in which he sang your
      praises very loudly.’

      “‘I was just looking for the offices when you came.’

      “‘We have not got our name up yet, for we only secured these
      temporary premises last week. Come up with me, and we will talk
      the matter over.’

      “I followed him to the top of a very lofty stair, and there,
      right under the slates, were a couple of empty, dusty little
      rooms, uncarpeted and uncurtained, into which he led me. I had
      thought of a great office with shining tables and rows of clerks,
      such as I was used to, and I daresay I stared rather straight at
      the two deal chairs and one little table, which, with a ledger
      and a waste paper basket, made up the whole furniture.

      “‘Don’t be disheartened, Mr. Pycroft,’ said my new acquaintance,
      seeing the length of my face. ‘Rome was not built in a day, and
      we have lots of money at our backs, though we don’t cut much dash
      yet in offices. Pray sit down, and let me have your letter.’

      “I gave it to him, and he read it over very carefully.

      “‘You seem to have made a vast impression upon my brother
      Arthur,’ said he; ‘and I know that he is a pretty shrewd judge.
      He swears by London, you know; and I by Birmingham; but this time
      I shall follow his advice. Pray consider yourself definitely
      engaged.’

      “‘What are my duties?’ I asked.

      “‘You will eventually manage the great depôt in Paris, which will
      pour a flood of English crockery into the shops of a hundred and
      thirty-four agents in France. The purchase will be completed in a
      week, and meanwhile you will remain in Birmingham and make
      yourself useful.’

      “‘How?’

      “For answer, he took a big red book out of a drawer.

      “‘This is a directory of Paris,’ said he, ‘with the trades after
      the names of the people. I want you to take it home with you, and
      to mark off all the hardware sellers, with their addresses. It
      would be of the greatest use to me to have them.’

      “‘Surely there are classified lists?’ I suggested.

      “‘Not reliable ones. Their system is different from ours. Stick
      at it, and let me have the lists by Monday, at twelve. Good-day,
      Mr. Pycroft. If you continue to show zeal and intelligence you
      will find the company a good master.’

      “I went back to the hotel with the big book under my arm, and
      with very conflicting feelings in my breast. On the one hand, I
      was definitely engaged and had a hundred pounds in my pocket; on
      the other, the look of the offices, the absence of name on the
      wall, and other of the points which would strike a business man
      had left a bad impression as to the position of my employers.
      However, come what might, I had my money, so I settled down to my
      task. All Sunday I was kept hard at work, and yet by Monday I had
      only got as far as H. I went round to my employer, found him in
      the same dismantled kind of room, and was told to keep at it
      until Wednesday, and then come again. On Wednesday it was still
      unfinished, so I hammered away until Friday—that is, yesterday.
      Then I brought it round to Mr. Harry Pinner.

      “‘Thank you very much,’ said he; ‘I fear that I underrated the
      difficulty of the task. This list will be of very material
      assistance to me.’

      “‘It took some time,’ said I.

      “‘And now,’ said he, ‘I want you to make a list of the furniture
      shops, for they all sell crockery.’

      “‘Very good.’

      “‘And you can come up to-morrow evening, at seven, and let me
      know how you are getting on. Don’t overwork yourself. A couple of
      hours at Day’s Music Hall in the evening would do you no harm
      after your labours.’ He laughed as he spoke, and I saw with a
      thrill that his second tooth upon the left-hand side had been
      very badly stuffed with gold.”

      Sherlock Holmes rubbed his hands with delight, and I stared with
      astonishment at our client.

      “You may well look surprised, Dr. Watson; but it is this way,”
      said he: “When I was speaking to the other chap in London, at the
      time that he laughed at my not going to Mawson’s, I happened to
      notice that his tooth was stuffed in this very identical fashion.
      The glint of the gold in each case caught my eye, you see. When I
      put that with the voice and figure being the same, and only those
      things altered which might be changed by a razor or a wig, I
      could not doubt that it was the same man. Of course you expect
      two brothers to be alike, but not that they should have the same
      tooth stuffed in the same way. He bowed me out, and I found
      myself in the street, hardly knowing whether I was on my head or
      my heels. Back I went to my hotel, put my head in a basin of cold
      water, and tried to think it out. Why had he sent me from London
      to Birmingham? Why had he got there before me? And why had he
      written a letter from himself to himself? It was altogether too
      much for me, and I could make no sense of it. And then suddenly
      it struck me that what was dark to me might be very light to Mr.
      Sherlock Holmes. I had just time to get up to town by the night
      train to see him this morning, and to bring you both back with me
      to Birmingham.”

      There was a pause after the stockbroker’s clerk had concluded his
      surprising experience. Then Sherlock Holmes cocked his eye at me,
      leaning back on the cushions with a pleased and yet critical
      face, like a connoisseur who has just taken his first sip of a
      comet vintage.

      “Rather fine, Watson, is it not?” said he. “There are points in
      it which please me. I think that you will agree with me that an
      interview with Mr. Arthur Harry Pinner in the temporary offices
      of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company, Limited, would be a
      rather interesting experience for both of us.”

      “But how can we do it?” I asked.

      “Oh, easily enough,” said Hall Pycroft, cheerily. “You are two
      friends of mine who are in want of a billet, and what could be
      more natural than that I should bring you both round to the
      managing director?”

      “Quite so, of course,” said Holmes. “I should like to have a look
      at the gentleman, and see if I can make anything of his little
      game. What qualities have you, my friend, which would make your
      services so valuable? or is it possible that—” He began biting
      his nails and staring blankly out of the window, and we hardly
      drew another word from him until we were in New Street.

      At seven o’clock that evening we were walking, the three of us,
      down Corporation Street to the company’s offices.

      “It is no use our being at all before our time,” said our client.
      “He only comes there to see me, apparently, for the place is
      deserted up to the very hour he names.”

      “That is suggestive,” remarked Holmes.

      “By Jove, I told you so!” cried the clerk. “That’s he walking
      ahead of us there.”

      He pointed to a smallish, dark, well-dressed man who was bustling
      along the other side of the road. As we watched him he looked
      across at a boy who was bawling out the latest edition of the
      evening paper, and running over among the cabs and busses, he
      bought one from him. Then, clutching it in his hand, he vanished
      through a doorway.

      “There he goes!” cried Hall Pycroft. “These are the company’s
      offices into which he has gone. Come with me, and I’ll fix it up
      as easily as possible.”

      Following his lead, we ascended five stories, until we found
      ourselves outside a half-opened door, at which our client tapped.
      A voice within bade us enter, and we entered a bare, unfurnished
      room such as Hall Pycroft had described. At the single table sat
      the man whom we had seen in the street, with his evening paper
      spread out in front of him, and as he looked up at us it seemed
      to me that I had never looked upon a face which bore such marks
      of grief, and of something beyond grief—of a horror such as comes
      to few men in a lifetime. His brow glistened with perspiration,
      his cheeks were of the dull, dead white of a fish’s belly, and
      his eyes were wild and staring. He looked at his clerk as though
      he failed to recognise him, and I could see by the astonishment
      depicted upon our conductor’s face that this was by no means the
      usual appearance of his employer.

      “You look ill, Mr. Pinner!” he exclaimed.

      “Yes, I am not very well,” answered the other, making obvious
      efforts to pull himself together, and licking his dry lips before
      he spoke. “Who are these gentlemen whom you have brought with
      you?”

      “One is Mr. Harris, of Bermondsey, and the other is Mr. Price, of
      this town,” said our clerk, glibly. “They are friends of mine and
      gentlemen of experience, but they have been out of a place for
      some little time, and they hoped that perhaps you might find an
      opening for them in the company’s employment.”

      “Very possibly! Very possibly!” cried Mr. Pinner with a ghastly
      smile. “Yes, I have no doubt that we shall be able to do
      something for you. What is your particular line, Mr. Harris?”

      “I am an accountant,” said Holmes.

      “Ah yes, we shall want something of the sort. And you, Mr.
      Price?”

      “A clerk,” said I.

      “I have every hope that the company may accommodate you. I will
      let you know about it as soon as we come to any conclusion. And
      now I beg that you will go. For God’s sake leave me to myself!”

      These last words were shot out of him, as though the constraint
      which he was evidently setting upon himself had suddenly and
      utterly burst asunder. Holmes and I glanced at each other, and
      Hall Pycroft took a step towards the table.

      “You forget, Mr. Pinner, that I am here by appointment to receive
      some directions from you,” said he.

      “Certainly, Mr. Pycroft, certainly,” the other resumed in a
      calmer tone. “You may wait here a moment; and there is no reason
      why your friends should not wait with you. I will be entirely at
      your service in three minutes, if I might trespass upon your
      patience so far.” He rose with a very courteous air, and, bowing
      to us, he passed out through a door at the farther end of the
      room, which he closed behind him.

      “What now?” whispered Holmes. “Is he giving us the slip?”

      “Impossible,” answered Pycroft.

      “Why so?”

      “That door leads into an inner room.”

      “There is no exit?”

      “None.”

      “Is it furnished?”

      “It was empty yesterday.”

      “Then what on earth can he be doing? There is something which I
      don’t understand in this manner. If ever a man was three parts
      mad with terror, that man’s name is Pinner. What can have put the
      shivers on him?”

      “He suspects that we are detectives,” I suggested.

      “That’s it,” cried Pycroft.

      Holmes shook his head. “He did not turn pale. He was pale when we
      entered the room,” said he. “It is just possible that—”

      His words were interrupted by a sharp rat-tat from the direction
      of the inner door.

      “What the deuce is he knocking at his own door for?” cried the
      clerk.

      Again and much louder came the rat-tat-tat. We all gazed
      expectantly at the closed door. Glancing at Holmes, I saw his
      face turn rigid, and he leaned forward in intense excitement.
      Then suddenly came a low guggling, gargling sound, and a brisk
      drumming upon woodwork. Holmes sprang frantically across the room
      and pushed at the door. It was fastened on the inner side.
      Following his example, we threw ourselves upon it with all our
      weight. One hinge snapped, then the other, and down came the door
      with a crash. Rushing over it, we found ourselves in the inner
      room. It was empty.

      But it was only for a moment that we were at fault. At one
      corner, the corner nearest the room which we had left, there was
      a second door. Holmes sprang to it and pulled it open. A coat and
      waistcoat were lying on the floor, and from a hook behind the
      door, with his own braces round his neck, was hanging the
      managing director of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company. His
      knees were drawn up, his head hung at a dreadful angle to his
      body, and the clatter of his heels against the door made the
      noise which had broken in upon our conversation. In an instant I
      had caught him round the waist, and held him up while Holmes and
      Pycroft untied the elastic bands which had disappeared between
      the livid creases of skin. Then we carried him into the other
      room, where he lay with a clay-coloured face, puffing his purple
      lips in and out with every breath—a dreadful wreck of all that he
      had been but five minutes before.

      “What do you think of him, Watson?” asked Holmes.

      I stooped over him and examined him. His pulse was feeble and
      intermittent, but his breathing grew longer, and there was a
      little shivering of his eyelids, which showed a thin white slit
      of ball beneath.

      “It has been touch and go with him,” said I, “but he’ll live now.
      Just open that window, and hand me the water carafe.” I undid his
      collar, poured the cold water over his face, and raised and sank
      his arms until he drew a long, natural breath. “It’s only a
      question of time now,” said I, as I turned away from him.

      Holmes stood by the table, with his hands deep in his trouser’s
      pockets and his chin upon his breast.

      “I suppose we ought to call the police in now,” said he. “And yet
      I confess that I’d like to give them a complete case when they
      come.”

      “It’s a blessed mystery to me,” cried Pycroft, scratching his
      head. “Whatever they wanted to bring me all the way up here for,
      and then—”

      “Pooh! All that is clear enough,” said Holmes impatiently. “It is
      this last sudden move.”

      “You understand the rest, then?”

      “I think that it is fairly obvious. What do you say, Watson?”

      I shrugged my shoulders. “I must confess that I am out of my
      depths,” said I.

      “Oh, surely if you consider the events at first they can only
      point to one conclusion.”

      “What do you make of them?”

      “Well, the whole thing hinges upon two points. The first is the
      making of Pycroft write a declaration by which he entered the
      service of this preposterous company. Do you not see how very
      suggestive that is?”

      “I am afraid I miss the point.”

      “Well, why did they want him to do it? Not as a business matter,
      for these arrangements are usually verbal, and there was no
      earthly business reason why this should be an exception. Don’t
      you see, my young friend, that they were very anxious to obtain a
      specimen of your handwriting, and had no other way of doing it?”

      “And why?”

      “Quite so. Why? When we answer that we have made some progress
      with our little problem. Why? There can be only one adequate
      reason. Some one wanted to learn to imitate your writing, and had
      to procure a specimen of it first. And now if we pass on to the
      second point we find that each throws light upon the other. That
      point is the request made by Pinner that you should not resign
      your place, but should leave the manager of this important
      business in the full expectation that a Mr. Hall Pycroft, whom he
      had never seen, was about to enter the office upon the Monday
      morning.”

      “My God!” cried our client, “what a blind beetle I have been!”

      “Now you see the point about the handwriting. Suppose that some
      one turned up in your place who wrote a completely different hand
      from that in which you had applied for the vacancy, of course the
      game would have been up. But in the interval the rogue had
      learned to imitate you, and his position was therefore secure, as
      I presume that nobody in the office had ever set eyes upon you.”

      “Not a soul,” groaned Hall Pycroft.

      “Very good. Of course it was of the utmost importance to prevent
      you from thinking better of it, and also to keep you from coming
      into contact with any one who might tell you that your double was
      at work in Mawson’s office. Therefore they gave you a handsome
      advance on your salary, and ran you off to the Midlands, where
      they gave you enough work to do to prevent your going to London,
      where you might have burst their little game up. That is all
      plain enough.”

      “But why should this man pretend to be his own brother?”

      “Well, that is pretty clear also. There are evidently only two of
      them in it. The other is impersonating you at the office. This
      one acted as your engager, and then found that he could not find
      you an employer without admitting a third person into his plot.
      That he was most unwilling to do. He changed his appearance as
      far as he could, and trusted that the likeness, which you could
      not fail to observe, would be put down to a family resemblance.
      But for the happy chance of the gold stuffing, your suspicions
      would probably never have been aroused.”

      Hall Pycroft shook his clinched hands in the air. “Good Lord!” he
      cried, “while I have been fooled in this way, what has this other
      Hall Pycroft been doing at Mawson’s? What should we do, Mr.
      Holmes? Tell me what to do.”

      “We must wire to Mawson’s.”

      “They shut at twelve on Saturdays.”

      “Never mind. There may be some door-keeper or attendant—”

      “Ah yes, they keep a permanent guard there on account of the
      value of the securities that they hold. I remember hearing it
      talked of in the City.”

      “Very good; we shall wire to him, and see if all is well, and if
      a clerk of your name is working there. That is clear enough; but
      what is not so clear is why at sight of us one of the rogues
      should instantly walk out of the room and hang himself.”

      “The paper!” croaked a voice behind us. The man was sitting up,
      blanched and ghastly, with returning reason in his eyes, and
      hands which rubbed nervously at the broad red band which still
      encircled his throat.

      “The paper! Of course!” yelled Holmes, in a paroxysm of
      excitement. “Idiot that I was! I thought so much of our visit
      that the paper never entered my head for an instant. To be sure,
      the secret must be there.” He flattened it out upon the table,
      and a cry of triumph burst from his lips. “Look at this, Watson,”
      he cried. “It is a London paper, an early edition of the _Evening
      Standard_. Here is what we want. Look at the headlines: ‘Crime in
      the City. Murder at Mawson & Williams’. Gigantic Attempted
      Robbery. Capture of the Criminal.’ Here, Watson, we are all
      equally anxious to hear it, so kindly read it aloud to us.”

      It appeared from its position in the paper to have been the one
      event of importance in town, and the account of it ran in this
      way:

      “A desperate attempt at robbery, culminating in the death of one
      man and the capture of the criminal, occurred this afternoon in
      the City. For some time back Mawson & Williams, the famous
      financial house, have been the guardians of securities which
      amount in the aggregate to a sum of considerably over a million
      sterling. So conscious was the manager of the responsibility
      which devolved upon him in consequence of the great interests at
      stake that safes of the very latest construction have been
      employed, and an armed watchman has been left day and night in
      the building. It appears that last week a new clerk named Hall
      Pycroft was engaged by the firm. This person appears to have been
      none other than Beddington, the famous forger and cracksman, who,
      with his brother, had only recently emerged from a five years’
      spell of penal servitude. By some means, which are not yet clear,
      he succeeded in winning, under a false name, this official
      position in the office, which he utilised in order to obtain
      moulding of various locks, and a thorough knowledge of the
      position of the strong room and the safes.

      “It is customary at Mawson’s for the clerks to leave at midday on
      Saturday. Sergeant Tuson, of the City Police, was somewhat
      surprised, therefore to see a gentleman with a carpet bag come
      down the steps at twenty minutes past one. His suspicions being
      aroused, the sergeant followed the man, and with the aid of
      Constable Pollock succeeded, after a most desperate resistance,
      in arresting him. It was at once clear that a daring and gigantic
      robbery had been committed. Nearly a hundred thousand pounds’
      worth of American railway bonds, with a large amount of scrip in
      other mines and companies, was discovered in the bag. On
      examining the premises the body of the unfortunate watchman was
      found doubled up and thrust into the largest of the safes, where
      it would not have been discovered until Monday morning had it not
      been for the prompt action of Sergeant Tuson. The man’s skull had
      been shattered by a blow from a poker delivered from behind.
      There could be no doubt that Beddington had obtained entrance by
      pretending that he had left something behind him, and having
      murdered the watchman, rapidly rifled the large safe, and then
      made off with his booty. His brother, who usually works with him,
      has not appeared in this job as far as can at present be

      see that even a villain and murderer can inspire such affection
      that his brother turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is
      forfeited. However, we have no choice as to our action. The
      doctor and I will remain on guard, Mr. Pycroft, if you will have
      the kindness to step out for the police.”
