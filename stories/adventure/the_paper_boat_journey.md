After the spring rain, Emma folded a newspaper into a perfect boat and set it in the rushing gutter stream.

But this wasn't any ordinary paper boat. As it sailed past the mailbox, Emma noticed she was shrinking, becoming small enough to climb aboard.

The boat carried her past towering dandelions that looked like golden trees, under bridges made of fallen twigs, and around boulders that were really just pebbles.

A friendly beetle wearing a tiny captain's hat helped navigate through the rapids near the storm drain. "First time sailing the neighborhood waters?" he asked.

Emma nodded, marveling at gardens that now seemed like vast jungles and puddles that stretched like lakes.

As the stream slowed, Emma grew back to her normal size. Her paper boat had carried her all the way around the block, ending up in her own backyard puddle.

She carefully lifted the soggy boat and set it on her windowsill to dry, already planning tomorrow's voyage.
