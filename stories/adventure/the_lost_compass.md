# The Lost Compass

Maya found the old brass compass buried in her grandmother's garden. Its needle spun wildly before pointing toward the forest behind their house.

"Follow me," she whispered to her little brother Sam.

The compass led them down a winding path they'd never seen before. Past twisted oak trees and over a babbling creek, until they reached a clearing where wildflowers grew in perfect circles.

In the center sat a tiny wooden chest, no bigger than a shoebox. Inside, they found dozens of hand-drawn maps from children who had followed the compass before them.

Maya carefully drew their own map and placed it with the others. The compass needle settled, pointing back home.

"Someone else will find it someday," Maya said, burying the compass in the same spot where she'd found it.

They walked home as the first stars appeared, knowing they'd given another child the gift of adventure.
