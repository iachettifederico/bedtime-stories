# The Tea Garden

Grandmother Willow's garden grew the most unusual plants. Instead of vegetables, she grew cups of tea.

Chamomile teacups bloomed on delicate vines, their handles curling like morning glories. Peppermint tea sprouted from neat rows, each cup steaming gently in the cool evening air.

Every sunset, Grandmother Willow would walk the garden paths with her wicker basket, carefully picking the ripest cups of tea.

"This lavender tea is perfect for sweet dreams," she would say, placing a purple cup in her basket. "And this honey tea will warm someone's heart."

The neighborhood cats knew about the garden and would visit each evening, delicately sipping from the cups that grew closest to the ground. They always left purring.

As night fell, Grandmother Willow would sit on her porch swing, sharing cups of garden tea with anyone who passed by. The mailman, the newspaper girl, even the shy little fox from the woods behind her house.

"Tea tastes best when shared," she always said, watching the stars appear one by one above her magical garden.
